      <abstract>This shapefile depicts the locations of thematic accuracy assessment sampling points used in the vegetation mapping of Colonial National Historical Park. It was developed by the Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation, Division of Natural Heritage. The data were created following general guidelines set forth by the USGS-NPS Vegetation Mapping Program. Accuracy assessment field work was performed in August through October 2005 by staff of the Virginia Division of Natural Heritage.</abstract>
      <purpose>This data set was created to identify the locations of sampling points used to assess the thematic accuracy of the Colonial National Historical Park vegetation map.</purpose>

        <procdesc>The number and distribution of accuracy assessment sampling points was determined by map class abundance and frequency as recommended in the USGS/NPS Vegetation Mapping protocols (The Nature Conservancy and Environmental Systems Research Institute 1994c), with one regional modification to accomodate the vegetation pattern seen in the park (Patterson 2008). A stratified random sampling approach was used, distributing the sampling effort across polygons representing natural or semi-natural vegetation greater than 0.5 ha. Polygons representing seven Anderson land-use classes were not included in the sample design: Beaches; Industrial and Commercial Complexes; Mixed Urban or Built-up Land; Other Urban or Built-up Land; Residential; Transportation, Communications, and Utilities; and Water. Four classes of cultural vegetation, Cultural Meadow, Dense Hardwood Regeneration, Mixed Successional Scrub, and Semipermanent Impoundment were also excluded from the accuracy assessment. These classes represent very distinct, intensively managed features that were easily delinated from aerial photography or classes with a few, very small polygons that were completely surveyed on-the-ground during the mapping phase of the project. Additionally, five map classes that naturally occur in small patches and were not mapped by photo interpretation, but through chance encounters in the field, were excluded from the sampling design: Coastal Plain Depression Wetland (Red Maple - Sweetgum - Willow Oak Type), Coastal Plain Depression Wetland (Swamp Tupelo Type), Coastal Plain Dry Calcareous Forest, Piedmont / Low Elevation Mixed Oak / Heath Forest, and Successional Sweetgum Forest. These map classes had very few (1-8) polygons and the polygons were mostly below minimum mapping unit (0.5 ha) and were completely surveyed on-the-ground during the mapping phase of the project. Three map classes that were created to indicate vegetation that may have formerly represented natural communities, but is now too altered to assign to a natural community classification, were excluded from the accuracy assessment. The polygons in these classes were mapped only due to chance encounters, were surveyed completely during the mapping phase of the project: Disturbed Calcareous Forest, Disturbed Depressional Wetland, Disturbed Seepage Swamp. One hundred and eighty-three randomly selected accuracy assessment sampling points were generated using the Random Point Generator v. 1.3 (Jenness 2005) in ArcView 3.3. All points were reviewed over topographic maps and aerial photos. Points were reassigned if the randomly selected point fell on a road, outside the park boundary or if there were potential access limitations. In August through October 2005, all 183 accuracy assessment points were located in the field by VADNH staff using a Garmin Map76S WAAS enabled GPS. Field staff determined the map class at the accuracy assessment point using a dichotomous key to the vegetation map classes and detailed vegetation descriptions.</procdesc>
