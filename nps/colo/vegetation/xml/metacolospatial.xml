      <abstract>This shapefile is an vegetation map of Colonial National Historical Park, Virginia. It was developed by The Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation, Division of Natural Heritage in cooperation with North Carolina State University's Center for Earth Observation for the Northeast Region of the National Park Service. The data was created following general guidelines set forth by the USGS-NPS Vegetation Mapping Program. Map classes are crosswalked to the U.S. National Vegetation Classification (USNVC) or level II of the Andersons land use land cover classification system. Crosswalks to the USNVC were determined on September 27, 2007. The map is based on field work performed in the summers of 2003-2005 and photo interpretation of aerial photo mosaics produced by North Carolina State University Center for Earth Observation from photography obtained in October 2001 and March 2002.</abstract>
      <purpose>This data set was created for Colonial National Historical Park for use in natural resource management.</purpose>

      <attraccr>The thematic accuracy of the vegetation map was assessed using a stratified random sampling approach, stratifying 183 samples among representing natural or semi-natural vegetation of polygons greater than 0.5 ha.  Sample size was determined by class abundance and frequency as recommended in section 4.4.2 of the USGS/NPS Vegetation Mapping Program standards, with one regional modification to accommodate the vegetation pattern seen in the park. Polygons were validated in the field by VADNH staff.  Polygons representing seven Anderson land-use classes were not included in the sample design: Beaches; Industrial and Commercial Complexes; Mixed Urban or Built-up Land; Other Urban or Built-up Land; Residential; Transportation, Communications, and Utilities; and Water.  Four classes of cultural vegetation, Cultural Meadow, Dense Hardwood Regeneration, Mixed Successional Scrub, and Semipermanent Impoundment were also excluded from the accuracy assessment.  These classes represent very distinct, intensively managed features that were easily delinated from aerial photography or classes with a few, very small polygons that were completely surveyed on-the-ground during the mapping phase of the project.  Additionally, five map classes that naturally occur in small patches and were not mapped by photo interpretation, but through chance encounters in the field, were excluded from the sampling design:  Coastal Plain Depression Wetland (Red Maple - Sweetgum - Willow Oak Type),  Coastal Plain Depression Wetland (Swamp Tupelo Type), Coastal Plain Dry Calcareous Forest, Piedmont / Low Elevation Mixed Oak / Heath Forest, and Successional Sweetgum Forest.  These map classes had very few (1-8) polygons and the polygons were mostly below minimum mapping unit (0.5 ha) and were completely surveyed on-the-ground during the mapping phase of the project. Three map classes that were created to indicate vegetation that may have formerly represented natural communities, but is now too altered to assign to a natural community classification were excluded from the accuracy assessment.  The polygons in these classes were mapped only due to chance encounters, were surveyed completely during the mapping phase of the project, and: Disturbed Calcareous Forest, Disturbed Depressional Wetland, Disturbed Seepage Swamp.  The Kappa index for the final vegetation map was 83.8 +/- 4.7%,  with the overall percent accuracy calculated as 84.7%.  Examination of the errors associated with each observation shows that they can be attributed to below minimum mapping unit inclusions of other vegetation types within the target polygons or to the incomplete survey of target polygons, to seasonal constraints in identifying certain associations in the field, and to observations made in ecotonal areas transitional to other vegetation types.  Additionally, some of the mapping errors were due to the difficulty of distinguishing deciduous associations on aerial photography, since many deciduous signatures are virtually identical.</attraccr>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>A preliminary vegetation map was created by viewing leaf-on (data captured 10-26-2001) and leaf-off (data captured 03-1-2002) digital photo mosaics, both in two and three dimensions.  Areas of homogenous vegetation, land cover, and land use were delineated using ArcMaps onscreen digitizing tools. The minimum mapping unit was 0.5 hectares (1.25 acres). Polygons were attributed to the formation-level of the USNVC Level II and Anderson's land use and land cover classification. The preliminary vegetation map served as a guide for field reconnaissance during the summers of 2003-2005.  Data were collected from 48 quantitative vegetation plots and qualitative observations throughout the park. Data were combined with data from other areas of the Mid-Atlantic Piedmont and Coastal Plain to refine the USNVC for the region. The draft formation-level vegetation map was extensively revised to better reflect vegetation units based on field information and using the following ancillary data layers; topographic maps and digital raster graphics (DRGs), National Wetland Inventory maps, County soil surveys, and the digital soil survey data (SSURGO). The edited polygons were reattributed with the association names from the refined USNVC.  One hundred and eighty-three thematic accuracy assessment points were randomly placed within the vegetation map, following a stratified random sampling plan. The Kappa Index for the final vegetation map was 83.8 +/- 4.7%, with an overall accuracy of 84.7%.</procdesc>

Nonstandard, park-specific units representing disturbed, cultural, or exotic vegetation were defined by Ecologists at the Division of Natural Heritage. Names for map classes not representing natural or semi-natural vegetation follow the Anderson level II land use and land cover classification scheme (Anderson et. al 1976).</attrdef>
