      <abstract>This shapefile depicts the locations of thematic accuracy assessment sampling points used in the vegetation mapping of Richmond National Battlefield Park. It was developed by the Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation, Division of Natural Heritage. The data were created following general guidelines set forth by the USGS-NPS Vegetation Mapping Program. Accuracy assessment field work was performed in the summer of 2006 and Spring 2007 by staff of the Virginia Division of Natural Heritage.</abstract>
      <purpose>This data set was created to identify the locations of sampling points used to assess the thematic accuracy of the Richmond National Battlefield Park vegetation map.</purpose>

        <procdesc>The number and distribution of accuracy assessment sampling points was determined by map class abundance and frequency as recommended in the USGS/NPS Vegetation Mapping protocols (The Nature Conservancy and Environmental Systems Research Institute 1994c), with one regional modification to accomodate the vegetation pattern seen in the park (Patterson 2008). A stratified random sampling approach was used, distributing the sampling effort across the USNVC map classes. Three cultural map classes, Cultural Meadow, Forested Earthworks, and Open Earthworks, and all Anderson II land use classes were excluded from the accuracy assessment.  Successional Black Walnut Forest and Successional Shrub Swamp were also excluded since they each were represented by a single, very small polygon that was thoroughly surveyed during the mapping phase of the project.  Seventy-one randomly selected accuracy assessment sampling points were generated using the Random Point Generator v. 1.3 (Jenness 2005) in ArcView 3.3. All points were reviewed over topographic maps and aerial photos.  Points were reassigned if the randomly selected point fell on a road, outside the park boundary or if there were potential access limitations. In August and September 2006, and May 2007, all 71 accuracy assessment points were located in the field by VADNH staff using a Garmin Map76S WAAS enabled GPS.  Field staff determined the map class at the accuracy assessment point using a dichotomous key to the vegetation map classes and detailed vegetation descriptions.</procdesc>
