      <abstract>This shapefile is an vegetation map of Richmond National Battlefield Park, Virginia. It was developed by The Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation, Division of Natural Heritage in cooperation with North Carolina State University's Center for Earth Observation for the Northeast Region of the National Park Service. The data was created following general guidelines set forth by the USGS-NPS Vegetation Mapping Program. Map classes are crosswalked to the U.S. National Vegetation Classification (USNVC) or level II of the Andersons land use land cover classification system. Crosswalks to the USNVC were determined on September 27, 2007. The map is based on field work performed in the summer of 2002-2006 and photo interpretation of aerial photo mosaics produced by North Carolina State University Center for Earth Observation from photography obtained in October 2001 and February 2002.</abstract>
      <purpose>This data set was created for Richmond National Battlefield Park for use in natural resource management.</purpose>

    <attracc>
      <attraccr>The thematic accuracy of the vegetation map was assessed using a stratified random sampling approach, stratifying 71 samples among USNVC map classes. Sample size was determined by class abundance and frequency as recommended in section 4.4.2 of the USGS/NPS Vegetation Mapping Program standards, with one regional modification to accommodate the vegetation pattern seen in the park. Polygons were validated in the field by VADNH staff. Three cultural map classes, Cultural Meadow, Forested Earthworks, and Open Earthworks, and all Anderson II land use classes were excluded from the accuracy assessment. Successional Black Walnut Forest and Successional Shrub Swamp were also excluded since they each were represented by a single, very small polygon that was thoroughly surveyed during the mapping phase of the project. The Kappa index for the vegetation map was 84.4% +/- 10.2%, with the overall percent accuracy calculated as 85.9%. Examination of the errors associated with each observation shows that they can be attributed to below minimum mapping unit inclusions of other vegetation types within the target polygons or to the difficulty of assigning a vegetation classification to very disturbed, transitional vegetation. Additionally some of the mapping errors may have been due to the difficulty of distinguishing deciduous types on aerial photography, since many deciduous signatures are virtually identical.</attraccr>

    <logic>Polygon geometry and topology were validated with ESRI ArcGIS v. 9.2 to find and correct any voids, slivers, overlapping polygons, or self-intersections.</logic>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>A preliminary vegetation map was created by viewing leaf-on (data captured 10-23-2001) and leaf-off (data captured 02-28-2002) digital photo mosaics, both in two and three dimensions. Areas of homogenous vegetation, land cover, and land use were delineated using ArcMaps onscreen digitizing tools. The minimum mapping unit was 0.5 hectares (1.25 acres). Polygons were attributed to the formation-level of the USNVC Level II and Anderson's land use and land cover classification. The preliminary vegetation map served as a guide for field reconnaissance during the summers of 2002-2006. Data were collected from 11 quantitative vegetation plots and qualitative observations throughout the park. Data were combined with data from other areas of the Mid-Atlantic Piedmont and Coastal Plain to refine the USNVC for the region. The draft formation-level vegetation map was extensively revised to better reflect vegetation units based on field information and using the following ancillary data layers; topographic maps and digital raster graphics (DRGs), National Wetland Inventory maps, County soil surveys, and the digital soil survey data (SSURGO). The edited polygons were reattributed with the association names from the refined USNVC. Seventy-one thematic accuracy assessment points were randomly placed within the vegetation map, following a stratified random sampling plan. The Kappa Index for the final vegetation map was 84.5 +/- 10.2%, with an overall accuracy of 85.9%.</procdesc>

Nonstandard, park-specific units representing disturbed, cultural, or exotic vegetation were defined by Ecologists at the Division of Natural Heritage.
