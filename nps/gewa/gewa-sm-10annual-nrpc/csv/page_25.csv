Discussion
This report summarizes the second year of nekton and vegetation data collection conducted at
"GEWA in 2010. Given the inherent inter-annual variability in the sampling design, it is not"
informative to make quantitative comparisons between two years of data. Continued monitoring
of salt marsh vegetation will allow us to distinguish between inter-annual variability and
significant trends in the vegetation community.
