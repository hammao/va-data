Wikum and Shanholtzer (1978) outline a method for calculating an importance value for each
"species. So as not to confuse this value with ecological importance, we rename it a ‘relative"
prevalence’ value. The calculation is essentially identical to that described in Wikum and
Shanholtzer’s publication. Although Wikum and Shanholtzer (1978) present their importance
"value as a sum of the percent frequency and percent cover values, this report takes the average of"
these values so that relative prevalence is on a more readily interpretable percent scale. We
"estimated the relative percent prevalence for each species and non-vegetation cover type present,"
which is equal to the average of the relative percent cover and the relative percent frequency.
Relative percent cover is the percentage of all plots that each species covers relative to all other
species present in the plots. The sum of all relative percent cover values for all species and non-
vegetation cover types equals 100%. Relative percent frequency is the number of plots where
"each species is present, relative to all other species observed in the plots. The sum of the relative"
percent frequency values for all species and non-vegetation cover type equals 100%.
Taking the average of the relative percent cover and the relative percent frequency gives the
relative percent prevalence for each species and non-vegetation cover type. Because the relative
"percent prevalence incorporates both percent frequency and percent cover, it is likely to differ"
substantially from the average percent cover for a given species or non-vegetation cover type.
The relative percent prevalence of a species provides information about how a species is
"distributed (i.e., its ‘patchiness’) throughout the salt marsh. We also report the average percent"
cover of each species for all plots combined.
"Lastly, if any vegetation species observed in the plots are listed by the United States Department"
"of Agriculture (USDA), or the commonwealth of Virginia as exotic, invasive, threatened,"
"endangered, or rare, these species are noted in the vegetation table. Individual plots that were"
"found to contain a species listed as exotic, invasive, threatened, endangered, or rare, will be"
"noted in Appendix B, which includes a table of all vegetation plots and their respective Universal"
"Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates. Information about plants listed by each state as exotic,"
"invasive, threatened, endangered, or rare is available online (USDA 2010). In some cases, more"
specific information may be available on state websites. Information about plants listed by the
commonwealth of Virginia as exotic or invasive is available online (Virginia Department of
Conservation and Recreation 2009). Information about plants listed by the commonwealth of
"Virginia as threatened, endangered, or rare can be obtained from an online report produced by"
the Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation (Townsend 2009).
