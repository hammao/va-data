Live vascular plants,Live vascular plants,(Herbaceous and shrubs) identified by species.
Standing non-living vascular plants,Standing non-living vascular plants,"Identified by species (e.g., S. alterniflora Not Living). This category only"
,,includes standing dead (attached) plants that are from a previous year’s
,,"growth. There may be some dead leaves from this year’s growth (e.g., the"
,,"ends of leaves or leaves that are being replaced by new growth, etc.). In"
,,"cases where dead leaves are from the current growing season, plant cover"
,,is recorded as live.
Macroalgae,,"Identified by species. This category generally includes the rockweeds (e.g.,"
,,"Fucus, Ascophyllum). Microalgae (e.g., diatom mats) and fine filamentous"
,,algae are not included in this category.
Bare ground,,"Includes mud, sand, microalgae cover, etc. These are areas that are not"
,,"flooded with water and are devoid of standing live, standing dead, or"
,,macroalgae. There can be a thin film of surface water within the bare ground
,,category.
Water,,"Permanent standing water is identified in plots that are partly within a creek,"
,,"ditch, marsh pool, or flooded panne."
Wrack/litter,,Wrack is material that has floated into the plot. This is generally dead (not
,,"attached) plant material, but could also be trash. Litter is dead plant material"
,,that is highly decomposed and is no longer attached.
Trash,,"Items such as logs, old piers, tires, etc."
Rock,,Boulders or rocks can be found on the surface of northern New England
,,marshes.
