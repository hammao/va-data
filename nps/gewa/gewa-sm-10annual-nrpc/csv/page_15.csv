Introduction
"National Park Service (NPS) managers need accurate information about how, when and why"
natural systems change over time in order to make sound management decisions. To address this
"need, the NPS initiated natural resource monitoring through the Natural Resource Challenge"
"funded by Congress in 2000. The Inventory and Monitoring Program (I&M), the key component"
"of this effort, organizes 270 park units into 32 networks tasked with conducting long-term"
ecological monitoring. Networks were required to develop a monitoring plan addressing the
implementation of long-term monitoring of key ecological indicators or “vital signs.” Vital signs
"are defined as measurable, early warning signals that may indicate change in the long-term"
health of natural systems. Early detection of potential problems allows park managers to take
steps in restoring or maintaining ecological health of park resources.
The Northeast Coastal and Barrier Network (NCBN) is made up of eight parks: Assateague
"Island National Seashore (ASIS, coastal Maryland and Virginia), Thomas Stone National"
"Historic Site (THST, Charles County, MD), Cape Cod National Seashore (CACO, Cape Cod,"
"MA), Gateway National Recreation Area (GATE, New York, NY and Sandy Hook, NJ), Fire"
"Island National Seashore (FIIS, Long Island, NY), Sagamore Hill National Historic Site (SAHI,"
"Oyster Bay, NY), Colonial National Historical Park (COLO, Virginia Peninsula), and George"
"Washington Birthplace National Monument (GEWA, Westmoreland County, VA). Vital Signs"
"chosen as part of the Network’s monitoring plan include salt marsh vegetation communities,"
"nekton communities, essential estuarine water quality parameters and specific coastal"
geomorphologic features (Stevens et al. 2005). Detailed monitoring protocols have been
developed and implemented in the eight parks. This annual report summarizes salt marsh nekton
and vegetation data collected in 2010 at George Washington Birthplace National Monument
"(GEWA) according to two protocols developed by James-Pirri and Roman, Monitoring Nekton"
"in Salt Marshes: A Protocol for the National Park Service’s Long-Term Monitoring Program,"
Northeast Coastal and Barrier Network and Monitoring Salt Marsh Vegetation: A Protocol for
"the National Park Service’s Long-Term Monitoring Program, Northeast Coastal and Barrier"
"Network (In Review-a,b)."
The objective of salt marsh monitoring is to identify long-term trends in the vegetation and
"nekton community structure, which will provide a better understanding of the current status and"
condition of salt marsh within the parks. Because salt marshes are located in coastal areas and
"many of the plant species are sensitive to subtle changes in soil salinity and saturation, changes"
in the percent cover and prevalence of some species will be important primary indicators of
change in salt marsh condition. Trends in the percent cover and prevalence of bare ground and
water will also provide information about changes in the overall condition of the salt marsh and
"whether or not it may transition to mud flat due to climate change (e.g., sea level rise, changes in"
temperature). Long-term monitoring data will provide park managers with the scientific data
they need to make informed decisions regarding the management and continued protection of
this rare and valuable coastal resource.
