Methods
Permanent Site Selection
One permanent salt marsh site (Dancing Marsh) was selected for vegetation and nekton
monitoring at GEWA (Figure 1). The number of sites chosen within the park was based on
available habitat and the logistics and feasibility of sampling. Detailed information about the site
selection process and sampling design can be found in the salt marsh protocols (James-Pirri and
"Roman In Review-a,b)."

NCBN at George Washington Birthplace National Monument (GEWA) in Viginia. This site will continue to
be monitored biennially.
Nekton Sampling Station Selection and Data Collection
Twelve nekton stations were randomly located along the tidal creek. Nekton stations were
"sampled twice, once in early summer on June 29-30 th (sampling took two days due to tides), and"
"once in late summer on August 10, 2010. Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates for"
each station are provided in Appendix A.
