Nekton in creeks less than 1 m deep were sampled with a 1 m2 aluminum throw trap (Kushlan
"1981, Sogard and Able 1991, Raposa and Roman 2001). The throw trap is an enclosure sampler"
"that has excellent efficiency and provides quantitative, repeatable results (Rozas and Minello"
"1997). The trap has an open top and bottom, is 0.5 m in height and 1 m square, and the sides are"
covered with 3 mm (1/8 in) wire mesh. All nekton were collected from the trap with a 1 mm
mesh dip net that fit snuggly within the opposite sides of the trap.
All fish and decapods were identified and enumerated. A representative number (up to 15
individuals) of each species collected was measured for length (fish & shrimp – total length;
"crabs – carapace width). Once identified and measured, all organisms were returned to the"
location where they were collected.
Vegetation Plot Selection and Data Collection
"Vegetation was sampled using randomly located, 1 m2 plots. Transects—extending from creek"
bank to upland—were systematically placed throughout the site based on a single random start.
Plots were then randomly located by treating all transects as a single transect and randomly
selecting approximately 50 points along this total length. This combination of systematic
transects and replicate plots is necessary to ensure interspersion of the plots throughout the marsh
"study area, thus providing a representative sample of all salt marsh communities (e.g., low"
"marsh, high marsh). Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates for each vegetation plot"
are provided in Appendix B.
"Vegetation sampling was conducted at GEWA on August 11, 2010. Fifty 1 m2 plots were"
"sampled. Each plot was visited once during the summer. For each plot, all vegetation species and"
"non-vegetation cover types were recorded (Table 1), and the estimated percent cover was"
"visually estimated using a modified Braun-Blanquet cover scale (0: 0%; 1: 
    "
"25%; 4: 26-50%; 5: 51-75%; 6: 76-100%), (Kent and Coker 1992)."
Data Summary
Nekton
"Species composition, average density, average length of nekton, and standard deviations were all"
calculated using standard formulae. The same is true of the average values of the physical
characteristics calculated for each habitat type during each visit. Details can be found in the
Analysis and Reporting Standard Operating Procedure of James-Pirri et al. (In Development-a).
Species richness was calculated using the algorithm described in Heltshe and Forester (1983). An
explanation and example of using the algorithm is provided in the Analysis and Reporting
Standard Operating Protocol of James-Pirri et al. (In Development-a).
Vegetation
Vegetation data were recorded using the modified Braun-Blanquet scale as described above
"(Kent and Coker 1992). For summary purposes, each Braun-Blanquet value was converted to the"
midpoint of the percent range it represented (Table 2) as described in Wikum and Shanholtzer
(1978).
