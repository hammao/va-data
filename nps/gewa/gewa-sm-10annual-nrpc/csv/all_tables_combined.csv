Executive Summary
The Northeast Coastal and Barrier Network (NCBN) is one of 32 networks of parks created by
the National Park Service (NPS) Inventory and Monitoring Program (I&M Program). The I&M
"Program has two components, 1) to collect baseline ecological inventory datasets and 2) to"
"implement Vital Signs monitoring, a long-term ecological monitoring program, in each of the 32"
networks. The Northeast Coastal and Barrier Network consists of eight parks linked by
geography and shared ecological characteristics along the Northeastern Atlantic Coast. As part of
"the I&M Program, each network has developed detailed protocols for monitoring a select number"
"of Vital Signs, or ecological indicators. Because the majority of parks in the NCBN are coastal"
"parks, salt marsh monitoring was chosen as a high priority and protocols were developed for"
collecting long-term data on salt marsh vegetation and nekton (James-Pirri and Roman In
"Review-a,b). The objective of monitoring vegetation and nekton is to identify long-term trends in"
"community structure, and to provide resource managers with a better understanding of the"
current status and condition of the salt marsh resources they manage.
The NCBN protocols for monitoring salt marsh were first implemented at George Washington
Birthplace National Monument (GEWA) in Virginia during the summer of 2008. This report
summarizes the second year of nekton and vegetation data collected at GEWA in 2010.
Monitoring will continue on a biennial basis.
The percent cover of each vegetation species and non-vegetation cover type within each 1 m2
plot was visually estimated using a revised Braun-Blanquet method (Kent and Coker 1992). Fifty
vegetation plots were sampled at GEWA in August 2010. A total of 18 vegetation species and
three non-vegetation cover types were recorded. Non-vegetation cover types observed included
"water, wrack & litter, and bare ground. Spartina alterniflora had the largest average percent"
"cover and was one of the most frequently observed species. One species, Phragmites australis, is"
listed as a highly invasive species in the state of Virginia (Virginia Department of Conservation
and Recreation 2009).
Nekton were sampled in the tidal creek exclusively. Five nekton species consisting of three fish
and two decapod species were captured at GEWA during the summer of 2010. The nekton
"community in 2010 was clearly dominated by fish, which accounted for 99.7% of all nekton"
"captured, with decapods making up less than 0.5% of the total catch. A single species, Fundulus"
heteroclitus (common mummichog) accounted for approximately 88% of all nekton captured at
GEWA in 2010.

Introduction
"National Park Service (NPS) managers need accurate information about how, when and why"
natural systems change over time in order to make sound management decisions. To address this
"need, the NPS initiated natural resource monitoring through the Natural Resource Challenge"
"funded by Congress in 2000. The Inventory and Monitoring Program (I&M), the key component"
"of this effort, organizes 270 park units into 32 networks tasked with conducting long-term"
ecological monitoring. Networks were required to develop a monitoring plan addressing the
implementation of long-term monitoring of key ecological indicators or “vital signs.” Vital signs
"are defined as measurable, early warning signals that may indicate change in the long-term"
health of natural systems. Early detection of potential problems allows park managers to take
steps in restoring or maintaining ecological health of park resources.
The Northeast Coastal and Barrier Network (NCBN) is made up of eight parks: Assateague
"Island National Seashore (ASIS, coastal Maryland and Virginia), Thomas Stone National"
"Historic Site (THST, Charles County, MD), Cape Cod National Seashore (CACO, Cape Cod,"
"MA), Gateway National Recreation Area (GATE, New York, NY and Sandy Hook, NJ), Fire"
"Island National Seashore (FIIS, Long Island, NY), Sagamore Hill National Historic Site (SAHI,"
"Oyster Bay, NY), Colonial National Historical Park (COLO, Virginia Peninsula), and George"
"Washington Birthplace National Monument (GEWA, Westmoreland County, VA). Vital Signs"
"chosen as part of the Network’s monitoring plan include salt marsh vegetation communities,"
"nekton communities, essential estuarine water quality parameters and specific coastal"
geomorphologic features (Stevens et al. 2005). Detailed monitoring protocols have been
developed and implemented in the eight parks. This annual report summarizes salt marsh nekton
and vegetation data collected in 2010 at George Washington Birthplace National Monument
"(GEWA) according to two protocols developed by James-Pirri and Roman, Monitoring Nekton"
"in Salt Marshes: A Protocol for the National Park Service’s Long-Term Monitoring Program,"
Northeast Coastal and Barrier Network and Monitoring Salt Marsh Vegetation: A Protocol for
"the National Park Service’s Long-Term Monitoring Program, Northeast Coastal and Barrier"
"Network (In Review-a,b)."
The objective of salt marsh monitoring is to identify long-term trends in the vegetation and
"nekton community structure, which will provide a better understanding of the current status and"
condition of salt marsh within the parks. Because salt marshes are located in coastal areas and
"many of the plant species are sensitive to subtle changes in soil salinity and saturation, changes"
in the percent cover and prevalence of some species will be important primary indicators of
change in salt marsh condition. Trends in the percent cover and prevalence of bare ground and
water will also provide information about changes in the overall condition of the salt marsh and
"whether or not it may transition to mud flat due to climate change (e.g., sea level rise, changes in"
temperature). Long-term monitoring data will provide park managers with the scientific data
they need to make informed decisions regarding the management and continued protection of
this rare and valuable coastal resource.

Methods
Permanent Site Selection
One permanent salt marsh site (Dancing Marsh) was selected for vegetation and nekton
monitoring at GEWA (Figure 1). The number of sites chosen within the park was based on
available habitat and the logistics and feasibility of sampling. Detailed information about the site
selection process and sampling design can be found in the salt marsh protocols (James-Pirri and
"Roman In Review-a,b)."
Figure 1. Aerial view and location of permanent nekton and vegetation monitoring site established by
NCBN at George Washington Birthplace National Monument (GEWA) in Viginia. This site will continue to
be monitored biennially.
Nekton Sampling Station Selection and Data Collection
Twelve nekton stations were randomly located along the tidal creek. Nekton stations were
"sampled twice, once in early summer on June 29-30 th (sampling took two days due to tides), and"
"once in late summer on August 10, 2010. Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates for"
each station are provided in Appendix A.
3
Nekton in creeks less than 1 m deep were sampled with a 1 m2 aluminum throw trap (Kushlan
"1981, Sogard and Able 1991, Raposa and Roman 2001). The throw trap is an enclosure sampler"
"that has excellent efficiency and provides quantitative, repeatable results (Rozas and Minello"
"1997). The trap has an open top and bottom, is 0.5 m in height and 1 m square, and the sides are"
covered with 3 mm (1/8 in) wire mesh. All nekton were collected from the trap with a 1 mm
mesh dip net that fit snuggly within the opposite sides of the trap.
All fish and decapods were identified and enumerated. A representative number (up to 15
individuals) of each species collected was measured for length (fish & shrimp – total length;
"crabs – carapace width). Once identified and measured, all organisms were returned to the"
location where they were collected.
Vegetation Plot Selection and Data Collection
"Vegetation was sampled using randomly located, 1 m2 plots. Transects—extending from creek"
bank to upland—were systematically placed throughout the site based on a single random start.
Plots were then randomly located by treating all transects as a single transect and randomly
selecting approximately 50 points along this total length. This combination of systematic
transects and replicate plots is necessary to ensure interspersion of the plots throughout the marsh
"study area, thus providing a representative sample of all salt marsh communities (e.g., low"
"marsh, high marsh). Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates for each vegetation plot"
are provided in Appendix B.
"Vegetation sampling was conducted at GEWA on August 11, 2010. Fifty 1 m2 plots were"
"sampled. Each plot was visited once during the summer. For each plot, all vegetation species and"
"non-vegetation cover types were recorded (Table 1), and the estimated percent cover was"
"visually estimated using a modified Braun-Blanquet cover scale (0: 0%; 1: 
    "
"25%; 4: 26-50%; 5: 51-75%; 6: 76-100%), (Kent and Coker 1992)."
Data Summary
Nekton
"Species composition, average density, average length of nekton, and standard deviations were all"
calculated using standard formulae. The same is true of the average values of the physical
characteristics calculated for each habitat type during each visit. Details can be found in the
Analysis and Reporting Standard Operating Procedure of James-Pirri et al. (In Development-a).
Species richness was calculated using the algorithm described in Heltshe and Forester (1983). An
explanation and example of using the algorithm is provided in the Analysis and Reporting
Standard Operating Protocol of James-Pirri et al. (In Development-a).
Vegetation
Vegetation data were recorded using the modified Braun-Blanquet scale as described above
"(Kent and Coker 1992). For summary purposes, each Braun-Blanquet value was converted to the"
midpoint of the percent range it represented (Table 2) as described in Wikum and Shanholtzer
(1978).

Standing non-living vascular plants,Standing non-living vascular plants,"Identified by species (e.g., S. alterniflora Not Living). This category only"
,,includes standing dead (attached) plants that are from a previous year’s
,,"growth. There may be some dead leaves from this year’s growth (e.g., the"
,,"ends of leaves or leaves that are being replaced by new growth, etc.). In"
,,"cases where dead leaves are from the current growing season, plant cover"
,,is recorded as live.
Macroalgae,,"Identified by species. This category generally includes the rockweeds (e.g.,"
,,"Fucus, Ascophyllum). Microalgae (e.g., diatom mats) and fine filamentous"
,,algae are not included in this category.
Bare ground,,"Includes mud, sand, microalgae cover, etc. These are areas that are not"

,,category.
Water,,"Permanent standing water is identified in plots that are partly within a creek,"
,,"ditch, marsh pool, or flooded panne."
Wrack/litter,,Wrack is material that has floated into the plot. This is generally dead (not
,,"attached) plant material, but could also be trash. Litter is dead plant material"
,,that is highly decomposed and is no longer attached.
Trash,,"Items such as logs, old piers, tires, etc."
Rock,,Boulders or rocks can be found on the surface of northern New England

Wikum and Shanholtzer (1978) outline a method for calculating an importance value for each
"species. So as not to confuse this value with ecological importance, we rename it a ‘relative"
prevalence’ value. The calculation is essentially identical to that described in Wikum and
Shanholtzer’s publication. Although Wikum and Shanholtzer (1978) present their importance
"value as a sum of the percent frequency and percent cover values, this report takes the average of"
these values so that relative prevalence is on a more readily interpretable percent scale. We
"estimated the relative percent prevalence for each species and non-vegetation cover type present,"
which is equal to the average of the relative percent cover and the relative percent frequency.
Relative percent cover is the percentage of all plots that each species covers relative to all other
species present in the plots. The sum of all relative percent cover values for all species and non-
vegetation cover types equals 100%. Relative percent frequency is the number of plots where
"each species is present, relative to all other species observed in the plots. The sum of the relative"
percent frequency values for all species and non-vegetation cover type equals 100%.
Taking the average of the relative percent cover and the relative percent frequency gives the
relative percent prevalence for each species and non-vegetation cover type. Because the relative
"percent prevalence incorporates both percent frequency and percent cover, it is likely to differ"
substantially from the average percent cover for a given species or non-vegetation cover type.
The relative percent prevalence of a species provides information about how a species is
"distributed (i.e., its ‘patchiness’) throughout the salt marsh. We also report the average percent"
cover of each species for all plots combined.
"Lastly, if any vegetation species observed in the plots are listed by the United States Department"
"of Agriculture (USDA), or the commonwealth of Virginia as exotic, invasive, threatened,"
"endangered, or rare, these species are noted in the vegetation table. Individual plots that were"
"found to contain a species listed as exotic, invasive, threatened, endangered, or rare, will be"
"noted in Appendix B, which includes a table of all vegetation plots and their respective Universal"
"Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates. Information about plants listed by each state as exotic,"
"invasive, threatened, endangered, or rare is available online (USDA 2010). In some cases, more"
specific information may be available on state websites. Information about plants listed by the
commonwealth of Virginia as exotic or invasive is available online (Virginia Department of
Conservation and Recreation 2009). Information about plants listed by the commonwealth of
"Virginia as threatened, endangered, or rare can be obtained from an online report produced by"
the Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation (Townsend 2009).

Discussion
This report summarizes the second year of nekton and vegetation data collection conducted at
"GEWA in 2010. Given the inherent inter-annual variability in the sampling design, it is not"
informative to make quantitative comparisons between two years of data. Continued monitoring
of salt marsh vegetation will allow us to distinguish between inter-annual variability and
significant trends in the vegetation community.
