Abstract:

This data set contains the river segments and bodies of water which have been either accepted into the scenic rivers program, qualify after evaluation for acceptance but have not yet joined the program, and those that are worthy of further study to determine suitability. The linework is from the standard USGS 1:100,000 DLGs of hydrology, 1995 US Census Tiger files, and EPA Stream Reach dataset.

Additional arcs were digitized against VBMP basemap imagery.



Purpose:

The Scenic Rivers Act of 1970 was passed to protect and preserve certain rivers or sections of rivers possessing natural or pastoral beauty. The DCR Dept of Planning and Recreation Resources (DPRR) works with citizens and local governments to study potential rivers, evaluates proposed rivers, reviews and comments on permit applications regarding impacts to scenic rivers, expands the information base about these rivers, and assists local governments to protect these rivers.

Supplemental_Information:

The Scenic Rivers dataset was developed to serve as a thematic layer on maps appearing in the Virginia Outdoors Plan. The original dataset was developed in ArcInfo and was further edited for the 2007 plan using ArcView 3.3 and ArcMAP 9.

DATA_QUALITY_INFORMATION


Attribute_Accuracy:

Attribute_Accuracy_Report:

The assigning of scenic river designation to the proper portion of the predefined hydrology data set as found in this data set has been done by the state agency with the authority and resources to do so. The DCR Department of Planning and Recreation Resources has received a set of maps showing the location and extent of these scenic rivers and river segments for the purposes of a review of the product. No problems have been noted to date. The coding is, therefore, considered correct and absolute for the stated scale. Quality control was performed in 2002 to weed out duplicate arcs and verify segment name labels. Complete dataset was updated 2012.

Logical_Consistency_Report:

All arcs in this data set are either scenic river segments or are used to define scenic river areal units. There are no other arcs or polygons.

Completeness_Report:

This data set is complete in its representation of two of the levels of scenic river status for Virginia as found in the 2007

Virginia Outdoors Plan - the legislatively designated scenic river components and the desirable/qualifying but not yet designated components. It does not include, by request of the DPRR, potential components proposed by citizen input as identified in the 2007

Virginia Outdoors Plan. It may well require updating after the next Virginia Outdoors Plan publication or draft publication.

Positional_Accuracy:

Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:

Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report: The horizontal accuracy can be determined by considering the lowest common denominator of all source datasets. These include 1:100,000 scale DLG's (original dataset used), 1995

US Census Tiger files, and EPA Stream Reach files (supplemented original data in 2002). This dataset was created as a reference dataset and no tests have been performed to quantify horizontal accuracy.

Overview_Description:

Entity_and_Attribute_Overview:

The arcs representing scenic rivers are coded with either DESIGNATED, QUALIFIED or WORTHY indicating designated or qualified segments, and those worthy of further study.

Water bodies that are scenic have the same codes. Names were assigned using Va DCR PRR staff and in some cases USGS

DRG labels.
