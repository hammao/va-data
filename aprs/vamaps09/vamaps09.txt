vamaps09.txt

This file contains a MAPLIST.VA and lots of Virginia maps.  A previous
version of VAMAPSxx.ZIP renamed some of Bob's standard distribution
files and you may have been using them...even though Bob had issued
updates of the maps by the original filename.  This version uses
the original filenames in the MAPLIST.  

Included are at least two new maps:  VASTIDE.MAP and VAVABCH.MAP for 
the South Tidewater and Virginia Beach areas respectively.

Send updates to Dan N4WZR at djv@gte.net.

Instructions:

1.  Download the ZIP file and put it in your APRS directory.
2.  At the DOS prompt, in the APRS directory, type the command:

	PKUNZIP -d VAMAPS09.ZIP

3.  MAPLIST.VA will go to the APRS\MAPLISTS directory and the
Virginia maps will go to the APRS\MAPS directory.
4.  In APRS, select (M)ap (C)hange_maplist amd enter "VA" to use
these maps.
