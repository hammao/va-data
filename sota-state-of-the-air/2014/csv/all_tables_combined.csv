We will breathe easier when the air in every
American community is clean and healthy.
We will breathe easier when people are free from the addictive
grip of tobacco and the debilitating effects of lung disease.
We will breathe easier when the air in our public spaces and
workplaces is clear of secondhand smoke.
We will breathe easier when children no longer
battle airborne poisons or fear an asthma attack.
"Until then, we are fighting for air."
About the American Lung Association
"Now in its second century, the American Lung Association is the leading organization working to"
"save lives by improving lung health and preventing lung disease. With your generous support, the"
