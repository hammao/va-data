I. In accordance with subdivision 7 of § 36-137 of the Code of Virginia, the local building department shall collect a 2% levy of fees charged for permits under this chapter and transmit it quarterly to DHCD to support training programs of the Virginia Building Code Academy. Localities that maintain individual or regional training academies accredited by DHCD shall retain such levy.  13 VAC 5-31-85. Accidents involving serious injury or death.
