Differential subsidance may occur in Udorthents.

This mapunit includes areas where shale bedrock or clay materials had been excavated; also included are other areas where iron or manganese had been mined in the past, other disturbed areas are also included.

Some areas contain Pits.  This part of the mapunit consists of open excavations from which soil and underlying material have been removed, exposing layers of bedrock in places.

Some areas contain Dumps. This part of the mapunit consists of smoothed or uneven accumulations or piles of spoil material."|"2525282:1977190"|"2525282:3707674"
