1For the United States as a country see, EIA, Monthly Energy Review, Section 12: Environment.  Differing methodologies between the two data series causes the total for all states to be slightly different from the national-level estimate.  The amount  varies no more than 0.5 percent.  See Appendix A for details on the data series differences.							
Note:  The District of Columbia is included in the data tables, but not in the analysis as it is not a state.
