"Virginia Drug Arrest Rate, 1999-2008"

Arrest-age population includes all persons age 10 and up.
The total drug arrest rate includes arrests of both juveniles (individuals age 10-17) and adults.
Drug arrest statistics can reflect law enforcement anti-drug activities and are not an accurate
indicator of drug prevalence.
