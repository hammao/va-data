1960 to 1980: Events and Governmental Response,
,"1960’s: Nationally and in Virginia, black citizens intensify their demands for civil rights, high unemployment and poverty exist"
,"in most black neighborhoods, whites move from the cities to the suburbs, and distrust of disproportionately white police forces"
,produces unusually high levels of anger and social alienation among black citizens.
,1962-1973: Significant increases in violent crime rates.
,"1964-1971: In this period, nationally, there are 750 race riots that kill 228 people, injure 12,750 others and result in 5,000 incidents"
,"of arson, the latter le aving many urban neighborhoods in ruins.3"
,1965-1973: Drug arrests rise sharply; African Americans grow angry about shouldering the burden of the Vietnam War draft
,and disillusionment among young whites (and eventually their parents) rises over law enforcement’s harsh response to anti-war
,protests.
,"1970-1975: The politically oriented Black Panther Party emerges nationally as well as urban gangs such as the Bloods, Crips and"
,"Posse, creating a sense of fear and danger throughout much of America."
,"1973-1980: In 1973, the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) restricts the flow of oil, which triggers"
,"high inflation and increases in unemployment and poverty. The economy enters a recession in 1979, the same year that property"
,and violent crime rates reach their highest levels since the 1930’s.
,1980: A “get tough on crime and criminals” movement develops in reaction to the social disorder of the 1960’s and 1970’s. The result
,is a steep rise in the use of incarceration for offenders and a call to end parole.
Federal Government Response,
•,1968: Congress passes the Omnibus Crime Control/Safe Streets Act in response to crime and social unrest. The Act creates the
,Law Enforcement Assistance Administration (LEAA) and establishes the first significant federal funding to states and localities
,"for crime control and criminal justice system improvements,"
