Very little empirical research has been done that compares crime prevention programs agency-to-agency or region-to-region in
"Virginia. Although federal grants require recipients to establish program goals and measurable objectives, it is not clear if this exercise"
continues when federal funding ends.
What seems apparent is the need for all stakeholders to come together in a collaborative fashion to address these issues and to lay out
"a plan for the advancement of crime prevention in the Commonwealth. Such an effort must include police chiefs and sheriffs, their"
"crime prevention specialists, and others from local government such as zoning officials, and city and county planners. Architects,"
"developers, and builders, as well as the academic experts on crime prevention need to be at the table as well. The not-for-profit Virginia"
"Crime Prevention Association and State government’s Crime Prevention Center have great experience and expertise to lend, and are"
the logical organizations to coordinate such an effort.
