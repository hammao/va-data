The Virginia Center for School Safety (VCSS)
"The VCSS’ mission is to improve safety and security in primary, secondary and post-secondary learning institutions. VCSS’s primary"
role in crime prevention is in its training of SROs and in its newly mandated (2005) responsibility for the conduct of annual school
security assessments (audits). A 2007 study found that 574 SROs were providing crime prevention services in 95% of high schools
"and 74% of its middle schools. SROs intervene in student conflicts before they evolve into criminal incidents, monitor school-based"
"anonymous crime-reporting programs, instruct law-related education classes and assist in anti-truancy, anti-drop out, anti-bullying and"
anti-gang programs. In addition they serve as role models and mentors who demonstrate the art of anger and conflict management. In
"conducting annual school security audits, VCSS staff encourages the upgrade of school security and safety policies, the use of CPTED"
"principles in the building or renovation of schools, and the standardization of school-based crime reporting."
VCSS also partners with the Virginia Department of Education and the University of Virginia in the conduct of the Virginia High
"School Safety Study, an ongoing research project that evaluates the effectiveness of school discipline practices and crime prevention efforts"
"that rely on supportive relationships with students. For more information, visit the VCSS website: www.dcjs.virginia.gov/vcss/."
2003: Virginia is recognized for the second time by the National Crime Prevention Council as having the best state level crime
prevention program in the United States. DCJS updates an earlier VCPA publication by issuing a new research-based report “The
"Status of Neighborhood Watch in Virginia,” Virginia Crime Prevention Center, March, 2003. DCJS’ SRO grant program peaks."
"At its peak in FY 2003, DCJS awarded federal funds that supported 93 new SRO positions and state funds that supported 46 SRO"
"positions. By FY 2007, federal funds supported 1 SRO position and state funds supported 34 SRO positions. Most localities assumed"
"the on-going costs of their grant initiated SRO positions, now recognized and appreciated as a modern necessity."
2003: Virginia Attorney General announces that the City of Richmond has been named by OJJDP as one of four demonstration sites
for its new Gang Reduction and Intervention Program (GRIP).
The Attorney General’s Anti-Gang Program (GRIP)
"Richmond GRIP, funded by a $2.5 million OJJDP grant, is a collaborative partnership between federal, state, community, non-profit,"
"for-profit, faith-based and community organizations. It provides coordinated access to private and public services for the families of"
at-risk and/or high-risk youth within the boundaries of two high-crime police beats in the City of Richmond.
The program’s goal is to identify at-risk youth before they become involved in gang activity and link the youths and their families to
services to strengthen the family unit and/or refer youth to recreational options that will lessen the attractiveness of the gang activity.
"To date, GRIP administrators have funded over 50 programs and seen a decrease in crime in the program’s target area. Because of its"
"success, GRIP is being replicated elsewhere in Richmond and is being considered for implementation by other localities."
2003: The Virginia State Police (VSP) creates a cadre of Certified Crime Prevention Specialists.
The Virginia State Police Crime Prevention Specialist Program
"VSP provides selected troopers with training in CPTED, business security, personal safety, workplace violence, crimes against"
"children, crime prevention for senior citizens and travel safety. This training is part of an intensified crime prevention curriculum that"
enables them to achieve DCJS certification as Crime Prevention Specialists (CPS). VSP’s Crime Prevention Coordinator serves as a
"CP instructor, helps fill trooper CP positions, responds to requests for crime prevention services, records departmental CP activity,"
and works to keep the 120-plus crime prevention staff qualified as certified CPSs.11 Trooper-CPSs now account for 30% of all active
CPSs with at least one assigned to each of 48 sub-division areas.
"Trooper CPSs normally devote an estimated 10% of their work time to crime prevention, although this varies by geographical"
"location. 12 They assess the environmental/physical security of highway rest areas, perform security assessments for businesses and"
"citizens, hand out CP literature, and deliver crime prevention talks or presentations. They may also attend regional CP meetings, work"
with local TRIAD groups and participate in school safety audits.
Two crime prevention services are unique to trooper-CPSs: the Virginia Judicial Security Initiative (VJSI) and the General Aviation
"Security Initiative (GASI). VJSI, coordinated through the OAG and the Virginia Center for Policing Innovation (VCPI), provides"
"specially trained trooper-CPSs to join with others in assessing the security of courthouses and, if requested, private residences of"
"judges. Since its inception (2005), an estimated 34 courthouses have been assessed. GASI is directed by the Virginia Department of"
"11	 The current Coordinator, Sgt. Lars Hermann is on the staff of the VSP Training Academy in Richmond, Virginia. He may be contacted at (804)"
