"The biggest concern to CP advocates at the current time is the problem of shrinking public budgets. In April of 2008, the Governor"
announced a shortfall in state revenue receipts that led him to order a state hiring freeze and a curtailment of other expenses. The
"economic downturn is also restricting the supply of federal monies. Consequently, towards the end of FY 2008, the Virginia Crime"
Prevention Association faced the possibility of no longer receiving the funds it relies upon for its operations.
Survey Findings
"The survey of agency CEOs and crime prevention practitioners provided detailed information on local CP efforts, information that"
revealed the strengths and weaknesses of these efforts.
Crime Prevention Strengths:
The strength of Virginia’s crime prevention efforts can be seen in the large and growing number of CP practitioners and programs.
"We estimate that about 400 law enforcement personnel are administering crime prevention services on a daily basis. In addition, 71%"
"of 90 agencies represented in the Specialist sample had created new or revived 148 local programs in the past five years, an average of"
2.3 such programs per agency. Strength is also reflected in the long and diverse list of active programs catalogued in Appendix A. The
many locality-specific programs on this list manifest the creativity these agencies apply as they address local crime prevention needs.
The survey also revealed broad support for increasing Virginia’s CP resources and organizational capacity. When asked what they
"would do to improve Virginia’s effort, the most frequent suggestions by CEOs and Specialists were to increase staff, allow more time"
"for existing staff to establish programs and deliver services, and to improve the quality of staff training. In addition, there were many"
"recommendations to establish more CPUs, improve cross-jurisdictional cooperation and facilitate the integration of crime prevention"
strategies within community policing operations.
Other indicators of strength were the findings that 70% of agency CEOs said their CP practitioners had attended anti-terrorism
"training, 71% of the 90 agencies represented in the Specialist sample reported new or revitalized crime prevention programs in the"
"past five years, and 68% or more of these 90 agencies had active SRO, CP material distribution, SRO taught Law-Related Education,"
Neighborhood Watch and Crimesolvers programs.
Crime Prevention Weaknesses
The survey did not address the question of weaknesses in agency-directed crime prevention efforts per se because there was no set of
"expectations or assumptions about these efforts prior to our research. Several weaknesses can be inferred, however, from the difficulties"
"respondents had in answering certain questions. For example, less than half of the 48 agency CEOs who reported crime prevention"
"discretionary funds could provide estimates of these funds. Apparently crime prevention budgets, and especially discretionary CP"
"funds, are not, as yet, an institutionalized component of local crime prevention efforts."
Other weaknesses were evident in the difficulties Specialists had in determining how active their agencies’ programs were or whether
"some were “more effective” than others. As noted in the text, these findings indicate a lack of precision with regard to standards of CP"
"program implementation and measures of program activity and performance. If this is not addressed, the institutionalization of the"
crime prevention function within law enforcement agencies may be limited.
The Future of Crime Prevention in Virginia
This report presents a snapshot of agency-directed crime prevention efforts in the Commonwealth. It identifies a baseline of crime
"prevention practices that, we hope, will enable CP advocates to learn and work from a statewide perspective when assessing these"
"practices. We also hope that it contributes to and encourages a dialog on the need for crime prevention program standards. Ideally, it"
will advance the idea that the mission of crime prevention should be embedded in all levels and types of Virginia policy-making.
We are presently faced with a budget crisis that will most likely prevent any dramatic further advances in agency CP programming.
No new federal funding streams are anticipated and those that exist are unlikely to grow in size. With both the federal government and
"the Commonwealth facing revenue shortages, the future is unclear. For these reasons, however, a statewide perspective may help to"
"identify areas, programs or initiatives which can be advanced without major budget impacts."
Much can be done without additional resources. Many of the survey respondents called for the preservation of progress already made
and suggested that the natural next step was to increase the integrity and uniformity of programs already established.
"Although a great variety of programs exists to accomplish the many tasks crime prevention experts have identified, a process is needed"
"to identify those that are most cost efficient, that make citizens and property owners feel safe, and that produce measurable reductions"
in crime. The way to do this is to: (1) develop and advance model policies and programs; (2) encourage uniformity in program
implementation: and (3) verify and validate model programs based on the goals and objectives they have been designed to achieve.
