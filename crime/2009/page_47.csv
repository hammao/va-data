Appendix B: Crime Prevention Work of Other State and Local Agencies
University and Community College Police and Security Forces
A detailed summary of the wide ranging crime prevention activity undertaken by college and university forces and contracted security
"forces is beyond the scope of this study and report. Since the massacre of students and staff at Virginia Tech on April 16, 2007, crime"
"prevention on campus has been of paramount importance at Virginia’s 69 two year and four year, public and private, institutions of"
higher learning.
The Virginia Division of Capitol Police (VDCP)
The Virginia Division of Capitol Police falls under the legislative branch of Virginia government and is responsible for general law
"enforcement in the Capitol District, that is, the facilities and state employees in the “capitol square” area of downtown Richmond,"
"Virginia and for several other state properties in the city. VDCP provides protective services for the Governor, Lieutenant Governor,"
"Attorney General, Supreme Court Justices and members of the General Assembly. It also provides court security for the Supreme"
Court and Virginia Court of Appeals.
VDCP has three Certified Crime Prevention Specialists. They provide crime prevention services in the areas of work place violence
"and theft prevention, suspicious persons, threatening phone calls and communications, confrontational customers, and personal"
"safety. In addition to giving crime prevention talks, they also perform security assessments of Capitol District facilities and participate"
in CPTED reviews of planned construction or renovation projects. Two specialists are currently assigned to the Capitol Security Work
"Team, which includes members of the Virginia State Police and the Department of Emergency Management. This team is responsibility"
for assessing critical infrastructure/key resources within Capitol District and providing recommendations to a subcommittee of
"representatives from the three branches of state government, several independent state agencies, the emergency manager for the city"
"of Richmond, and the U.S. Marshall’s Service."
The Virginia Department of Alcohol Beverage Control
ABC’s 130 Special Agents and staff are primarily tasked with the enforcement of laws and regulations dealing with the consumption and
"distribution of alcohol. Coincidentally, they administer programs designed to prevent alcohol abuse and reduce its illegal distribution."
Each of ABCs nine regional or satellite offices offers a Speaker Bureau whereby ABC agents can be called upon to deliver alcohol
awareness programs to groups and organizations in the local community. ABC also sponsors an annual ABC College Conference for
college student leaders and a summer week-long program for high-school leaders called the Youth Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention
"Project (YADAPP). In addition to promoting responsibility in the use of alcohol, both events offer workshops about the danger of"
illegal drugs and violence prevention.
ABC has recently unveiled a new program titled the Alcohol and Aging Awareness Group (AAAG). This program recognizes that
"alcohol abuse is a growing problem facing older Americans. Created in response to a recent act of the General Assembly, AAAG"
enables its licensees to educate ABC customers and caregivers about alcohol misuse among Virginia’s aging population. Call 213-4445
for information.
The Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT)
"Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, VDOT security personnel have adopted a number of proactive crime prevention"
strategies to secure Virginia’s land transportation infrastructure. Staff have installed electronic gates to control traffic on evacuation
"routes, implemented a statewide unified “smart card” identification and access control system, conducted additional background"
"checks on VDOT staff and contractors working at critical infrastructure sites, installed security cameras, and conducted comprehensive"
security assessments at all VDOT critical facilities.
"In addition, VDOT security personnel participate in homeland security exercises, and work with VSP and disaster preparedness"
"agencies on plans to prevent or control chemical, biological or nuclear attacks. They also worked with VSP to enhance security during"
the recent celebrations of the Jamestown Colony’s 400th anniversary. The VDOT Operations and Security Division is staffed by
approximately 30 personnel.
