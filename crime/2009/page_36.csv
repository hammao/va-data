Summary and Comments
Virginia History
Virginia’s law enforcement officials were among the nation’s first to advance crime prevention programming as a response to the
crime trends and social unrest of the past 30 or 40 years. The timeline of crime prevention milestones shows Virginia to be a leader
"in the development of Neighborhood Watch, the application of Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED)"
"principles, implementation of community-oriented policing strategy, TRIAD programming, the use of SROs in secondary schools,"
the development of internet crime policies and use of Citizen Police Academies.
Virginia’s state and local officials have made crime prevention an institutionalized component of the Commonwealth’s approach to law
enforcement. This is evidenced by the fact that Virginia:
"(1) was among the first states (1977) to hire state-level employees whose only function was to promote crime prevention, first to"
"establish (1989) a state-level crime prevention unit (the Department of Criminal Justice Service’s Crime Prevention Section), and"
"first (1994) to create and staff a legislatively mandated (§ 9.1-158) state-level Crime Prevention Center (CPC). In 2001, the CPC"
was the first to create a state-administered Certified Crime Prevention Community Program that recognizes localities that have
implemented a wide range of community crime prevention initiatives.
"(2) was among the first states (1978) to establish a private, non-profit organization (the Virginia Crime Prevention Association"
"(VCPA)) whose mission was to partner with public and private organizations to provide CP training, initiate development of"
new crime prevention programs (such as VCPA’s work with public housing authorities) and organize new crime prevention
"organizations. For example, VCPA helped to establish five regional crime prevention associations and one of the nation’s first"
"statewide interdisciplinary “Safer By Design” coalitions, a group that advocates the use of CPTED principles in building, landscape,"
and greenways design.
(3) 	has a cadre of at least 400 crime prevention practitioners who create and maintain local programs. Virginia’s officials have bolstered
the professional stature of these practitioners through the DCJS Certified Crime Prevention Specialist (CPS) program (1989)
"and continue to do so. One of the first of its kind in the nation, the CPS program provides state of the art training in all aspects of"
"crime prevention including CPTED, terrorist threat assessment, and crime analysis."
"(4)	 has been a national leader in the placement of SROs (sworn officers) in primary and secondary schools. Today, there are nearly 600"
"SROs in Virginia’s high schools and middle schools, the great majority of whom have received training through the legislatively"
"established Virginia Center for School Safety (2001), an entity housed within the DCJS. SROs provide daily crime prevention"
services to a large percentage of Virginia’s most crime-prone population cohort. Virginia is also one of the first states (2006) to
"establish a state-level entity to monitor and guide crime prevention efforts on its college and university campuses, the Office of"
Campus Policing and Security (OCPS).
"Virginia has also taken advantage of the many federal funding streams that address crime and crime prevention. For example, Virginia"
"has used federal dollars from the National Sheriffs’ Association to bolster its Neighborhood Watch programs, U.S. Attorney’s Office"
"(DOJ) funds to establish “weed and seed,” TRIAD, Class Action, GREAT and GRIP programs, COPS money to establish community"
"policing, crime prevention and SRO positions, federal Edward R. Byrne Memorial and Safe and Drug Free Schools/Communities"
"monies to fund more SRO positions, and Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Program and other DHS funds to teach law"
enforcement officers how to prevent and combat terrorism.
"As the timeline of crime prevention milestones suggests, Virginia has had the advantage of strong statewide leadership from the DCJS"
Crime Prevention Center and the Virginia Crime Prevention Association. From the state’s early initiatives on Neighborhood Watch
and the application of CPTED principles to its development of certification programs for Crime Prevention Specialists and Certified
"Crime Prevention Communities, these entities have kept Virginia on the cutting edge of the discipline."
"One concern revealed by the historical data, however, is the relatively small amount of state funding devoted to crime prevention."
Other than appropriations to create new SRO positions 31 and funds appropriated to the Virginia Crime Prevention Association to
"conduct training, state funding is mainly supplied to maintain the DCJS Crime Prevention Center."
31	 Only 30 such positions are being funded during FY2008-2009.
