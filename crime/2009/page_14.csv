security.

Virginia’s Response
"2000: Using state funds, DCJS begins awarding grants for the establishment of new SRO positions."
2001: The DCJS Crime Prevention Center (CPC) establishes the Certified Crime Prevention Community Program (CCPC)
The DCJS Certified Crime Prevention Community Program (CCPC)
The CCPC recognizes and certifies localities that have demonstrated a commitment to safety by meeting twelve “core” elements and
"at least seven “optional” elements and, thereby, establishing a comprehensive community safety/crime prevention effort. Believed"
"to be the only one of its kind nationally, the CCPC encourages localities to develop and implement collaborative community safety"
"plans within a flexible framework. Furthermore, it provides an ongoing process by which communities can reassess and update their"
safety/crime prevention plans to address emerging issues. The certification gives CCPC localities preference in the state criminal
justice grant application process and has been used to foster economic development and to bolster a locality’s application for the All
American Cities designation.
The Crime Prevention Center staff provides step-by-step guidance and technical assistance to communities seeking initial certification
or subsequent re-certification. The certification process is rigorous and requires detailed documentation and verification of compliance
"for each element. A subcommittee presents nominations to the Virginia Criminal Justice Services Board (CJSB), which makes the"
"final determination of award. Localities which have earned the designation “Certified Crime Prevention Community” as of May 30,"
"2008 are the cities of Bristol, Galax, Hampton, Lynchburg, Newport News, Portsmouth, Radford, Roanoke and Virginia Beach; the"
"counties of Fairfax, Hanover, Henrico and Prince William, and the town of Herndon. Over 30% of Virginia’s population resides in"
CCPC certified communities.
2001: Virginia is the first state to establish a legislatively mandated Virginia Center for School Safety (VCSS) within the Department
of Criminal Justice Services.
"10	 The OAG also promotes crime prevention through its partnerships and programs on domestic violence, family internet safety, and"
"methamphetamines addiction, law enforcement mentoring to at-risk youth, etc."
