Evolution of Crime Prevention and Law Enforcement
"NOTE: If you are unfamiliar with the name or purpose of a particular crime prevention program, please consult Appendix A which lists and"
defines existing programs.
"When Sir Robert Peel established the first modern police force in 1829 (the Metropolitan London Police), the primary goal was to"
"prevent crime. The mere presence of police officers, it was assumed, would be enough to discourage serious criminal behavior. This"
"notion of the role of the police changed significantly after 1900 when crime, anti-immigrant riots and anarchists threatened social"
"order and forced police officers to focus increasingly on searching out and arresting law breakers. By the 1930’s, the idea of policemen"
as law enforcers was well established. Some say the defining milestone of this change in role was the creation in the United States of
the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in 1935.
"As the task of law enforcement grew, however, so did the demand for police officers who could specialize. Police executives found"
"they needed officers to function solely as detectives, forensic experts, record keepers, and trainers. As this trend continued, and"
"agencies created specialized sub-units and positions, the role of crime prevention as a tool of law enforcement became increasingly"
institutionalized. It is the story of this institutionalization that underlies this report.
"By the mid-1960s, questions were being raised about the adequacy of the “police as law enforcers” model. The civil rights struggle,"
"the effects of poverty and unemployment in our increasingly segregated inner-cities, the growth of the counter-culture, and the"
increasingly violent anti-war movement produced an awareness that crime stemmed from social forces as much as individual deviancy.
The widespread social disarray generated concern about the ability of police forces to maintain order. Officials began to see that a new
"approach to law enforcement was needed, one involving a greater understanding of and response to social forces, and the active assistance of"
the citizenry-at-large.
"The importance of the public’s support and engagement was highlighted by the 1964 murder of Kitty Genovese in New York City,"
"a crime the media reported as having been witnessed by thirty-eight persons, none of whom came to her aid in any substantial way."
"Soon after, the idea of training neighbors to watch out for each others’ safety (a notion put forth and experimented with as early as the"
1930’s) gained public credibility. This and the fact that much of the disarray was blamed on young people accounts for the fact that by
"the 1970’s, states and localities were using newly available federal grant funds to establish Neighborhood Watch programs and to fight"
juvenile delinquency.
"In the 1970’s and 1980’s, the size of the crime-prone age group of the population (roughly ages 15 to 24) peaked, illegal drugs were"
"plentiful, unemployment in inner-cities was high, and the rates of burglary, theft and murder were the highest they had been since"
"the 1930’s. In response, Congress supplied more anti-crime funding and governments at all levels adopted “get tough” policies that"
"increased the use and length of incarceration. In addition, criminologists provided more evidence about the ways that poverty, drugs"
and neighborhood blight contribute to crime. Both the “broken windows” and “community policing” strategies gained currency and
"programs such as “weed and seed,” gang intervention, code enforcement, foot and bike patrols, and “crimesolvers” were initiated."
"As law enforcement officials enlisted more and more help from citizens, they also called for specialized “community policing” units"
"and the creation of a new type of police officer, the crime prevention specialist. The day-to-day implementation of “community"
policing” required a level of time commitment and crime prevention expertise beyond those practicable or needed by patrol officers.
"Crime prevention specialists were needed to create programs for educating citizens (self-protection), soliciting help from citizens"
"(Crimesolver tip lines), and making crime more difficult to commit (Crime Prevention through Environmental Design (CPTED)."
"From this time forward, crime prevention, crime prevention units and crime prevention specialty positions became increasingly"
institutionalized within the nation’s and Virginia’s law enforcement agencies.
"The 1990s saw a dramatic increase in another crime prevention specialist position, the School Resource Officer (SRO). SROs are"
"sworn law enforcement officers who serve in middle and high schools. Although they act as law enforcers, they also work to develop"
in-school crime prevention programs. The SRO position evolved in the 1970’s and 1980’s out of concern over the ever-younger average
"age of criminal delinquents. The numbers of SROs increased dramatically, however, in response to the tragic school shootings that"
"shocked the nation in the latter ‘90’s. Two federal anti-crime programs, the Justice Department’s “Cops in School” program (1994)"
and Edward G. Byrne Memorial Formula Grant Program were used to increase SROs positions. The bolstering of the SRO represents
another milestone in the institutionalization of crime prevention as a component of law enforcement.
"Since 2000, crime prevention’s institutionalization continued as the nation’s law enforcement agencies reacted to two calamitous events,"
"one social phenomenon and a demographic shift. The first event, the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, made law enforcement"
"officials instantly aware of the need to prevent further terrorism-related criminal activity (crime prevention) and the second, the"
