"December 31, 2008"
“Crime prevention is a pattern of attitudes
and behaviors directed at reducing the threat of crime
"and enhancing the sense of safety and security,"
to positively influence the quality of life in our society
and to develop environments in which
crime cannot flourish.”

Context of Law Enforcement-Based Crime Prevention Efforts,
There are at least five crime prevention strategies:,
1.,Socio-economic prevention: Governmental policies/programs that ameliorate the broader causal conditions of crime such as
,"poverty, unemployment, family disintegration, poor educational resources, inadequate parenting, neighborhood blight, social"
,"discontent, etc."
2.,Socialization-prevention: Programs that help “at-risk” juveniles overcome the effects of the aforementioned conditions so they’re
,"not as easily drawn to criminal activity. These programs include mentoring, tutoring, after-school programming, truancy and"
,"drop out prevention, character and legal education, job training, drug awareness, etc."
3.,Incapacitation-prevention: Prosecutorial and judicial policies that confine offenders as a way to prevent their further involvement
,in public criminal behavior.
4.,Rehabilitation-prevention: Treatment programs to help legally sanctioned offenders or other at-risk individuals avoid future
,"criminal behavior. Modalities include juvenile and adult probation, drug treatment, mental health treatment, job training,"
,"character education, offender re-entry programs, and others."
5.,"Deterrence-prevention: Programs/policies that create and maintain a humane, just, and effective criminal justice system and those"
,"that attempt to increase the physical and psychological costs of criminal behavior. These include target hardening strategies,"
,"establishment of neighborhood and business crime watch groups, use of School Resource Officers (SROs) in middle and high"
,schools and the training of citizens to make them more aware of criminal activity and how to avoid being victimized.

Evolution of Crime Prevention and Law Enforcement
"NOTE: If you are unfamiliar with the name or purpose of a particular crime prevention program, please consult Appendix A which lists and"
defines existing programs.
"When Sir Robert Peel established the first modern police force in 1829 (the Metropolitan London Police), the primary goal was to"
"prevent crime. The mere presence of police officers, it was assumed, would be enough to discourage serious criminal behavior. This"
"notion of the role of the police changed significantly after 1900 when crime, anti-immigrant riots and anarchists threatened social"
"order and forced police officers to focus increasingly on searching out and arresting law breakers. By the 1930’s, the idea of policemen"
as law enforcers was well established. Some say the defining milestone of this change in role was the creation in the United States of
the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in 1935.
"As the task of law enforcement grew, however, so did the demand for police officers who could specialize. Police executives found"
"they needed officers to function solely as detectives, forensic experts, record keepers, and trainers. As this trend continued, and"
"agencies created specialized sub-units and positions, the role of crime prevention as a tool of law enforcement became increasingly"
institutionalized. It is the story of this institutionalization that underlies this report.
"By the mid-1960s, questions were being raised about the adequacy of the “police as law enforcers” model. The civil rights struggle,"
"the effects of poverty and unemployment in our increasingly segregated inner-cities, the growth of the counter-culture, and the"
increasingly violent anti-war movement produced an awareness that crime stemmed from social forces as much as individual deviancy.
The widespread social disarray generated concern about the ability of police forces to maintain order. Officials began to see that a new
"approach to law enforcement was needed, one involving a greater understanding of and response to social forces, and the active assistance of"
the citizenry-at-large.
"The importance of the public’s support and engagement was highlighted by the 1964 murder of Kitty Genovese in New York City,"
"a crime the media reported as having been witnessed by thirty-eight persons, none of whom came to her aid in any substantial way."
"Soon after, the idea of training neighbors to watch out for each others’ safety (a notion put forth and experimented with as early as the"
1930’s) gained public credibility. This and the fact that much of the disarray was blamed on young people accounts for the fact that by
"the 1970’s, states and localities were using newly available federal grant funds to establish Neighborhood Watch programs and to fight"
juvenile delinquency.
"In the 1970’s and 1980’s, the size of the crime-prone age group of the population (roughly ages 15 to 24) peaked, illegal drugs were"
"plentiful, unemployment in inner-cities was high, and the rates of burglary, theft and murder were the highest they had been since"
"the 1930’s. In response, Congress supplied more anti-crime funding and governments at all levels adopted “get tough” policies that"
"increased the use and length of incarceration. In addition, criminologists provided more evidence about the ways that poverty, drugs"
and neighborhood blight contribute to crime. Both the “broken windows” and “community policing” strategies gained currency and
"programs such as “weed and seed,” gang intervention, code enforcement, foot and bike patrols, and “crimesolvers” were initiated."
"As law enforcement officials enlisted more and more help from citizens, they also called for specialized “community policing” units"
"and the creation of a new type of police officer, the crime prevention specialist. The day-to-day implementation of “community"
policing” required a level of time commitment and crime prevention expertise beyond those practicable or needed by patrol officers.
"Crime prevention specialists were needed to create programs for educating citizens (self-protection), soliciting help from citizens"
"(Crimesolver tip lines), and making crime more difficult to commit (Crime Prevention through Environmental Design (CPTED)."
"From this time forward, crime prevention, crime prevention units and crime prevention specialty positions became increasingly"
institutionalized within the nation’s and Virginia’s law enforcement agencies.
"The 1990s saw a dramatic increase in another crime prevention specialist position, the School Resource Officer (SRO). SROs are"
"sworn law enforcement officers who serve in middle and high schools. Although they act as law enforcers, they also work to develop"
in-school crime prevention programs. The SRO position evolved in the 1970’s and 1980’s out of concern over the ever-younger average
"age of criminal delinquents. The numbers of SROs increased dramatically, however, in response to the tragic school shootings that"
"shocked the nation in the latter ‘90’s. Two federal anti-crime programs, the Justice Department’s “Cops in School” program (1994)"
and Edward G. Byrne Memorial Formula Grant Program were used to increase SROs positions. The bolstering of the SRO represents
another milestone in the institutionalization of crime prevention as a component of law enforcement.
"Since 2000, crime prevention’s institutionalization continued as the nation’s law enforcement agencies reacted to two calamitous events,"
"one social phenomenon and a demographic shift. The first event, the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, made law enforcement"
"officials instantly aware of the need to prevent further terrorism-related criminal activity (crime prevention) and the second, the"

1960 to 1980: Events and Governmental Response,
,"1960’s: Nationally and in Virginia, black citizens intensify their demands for civil rights, high unemployment and poverty exist"
,"in most black neighborhoods, whites move from the cities to the suburbs, and distrust of disproportionately white police forces"
,produces unusually high levels of anger and social alienation among black citizens.
,1962-1973: Significant increases in violent crime rates.
,"1964-1971: In this period, nationally, there are 750 race riots that kill 228 people, injure 12,750 others and result in 5,000 incidents"
,"of arson, the latter le aving many urban neighborhoods in ruins.3"
,1965-1973: Drug arrests rise sharply; African Americans grow angry about shouldering the burden of the Vietnam War draft
,and disillusionment among young whites (and eventually their parents) rises over law enforcement’s harsh response to anti-war
,protests.
,"1970-1975: The politically oriented Black Panther Party emerges nationally as well as urban gangs such as the Bloods, Crips and"
,"Posse, creating a sense of fear and danger throughout much of America."
,"1973-1980: In 1973, the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) restricts the flow of oil, which triggers"
,"high inflation and increases in unemployment and poverty. The economy enters a recession in 1979, the same year that property"
,and violent crime rates reach their highest levels since the 1930’s.
,1980: A “get tough on crime and criminals” movement develops in reaction to the social disorder of the 1960’s and 1970’s. The result
,is a steep rise in the use of incarceration for offenders and a call to end parole.
Federal Government Response,
•,1968: Congress passes the Omnibus Crime Control/Safe Streets Act in response to crime and social unrest. The Act creates the
,Law Enforcement Assistance Administration (LEAA) and establishes the first significant federal funding to states and localities
,"for crime control and criminal justice system improvements,"

,"1990, the percentage of persons under the jurisdiction of state correctional authorities for drug crimes rose from 6.5% to 22% with a"
,disproportionate percentage of them being African-Americans. This is a consequence of the “get tough” policies formed in response to
,the 1960’s and 1970’s crime and social unrest
,Federal Government Response
,1984: Omnibus Crime Control Act creates the Office of Justice Programs (OJP) to coordinate programming of several existing
,"and sometimes competing federal agencies, the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), the Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA) (successor"
,"to LEAA), the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) and the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) grant"
,program that provided federal funds to states and localities.
,"1986 and 1988: Anti-Drug Acts establish the bulk of mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses prosecuted in federal court,"

effectively transferring sentencing powers from federal judges to prosecutors. Lower-level drug offenders also more likely to be
incarcerated based on the notion of conspiracy to commit drug crime.
"1988: The Byrne Memorial State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance Program is established, with funds going predominantly to"
"crime prevention and drug law enforcement. In 1990, the Omnibus Crime Control Act extends and increases Byrne funds."

DCJS are selected Best State Crime Prevention Program in the country by the National Crime Prevention Council (NCPC).
1991 to 2000: Events and Governmental Response
"1991: Index Crime, as reported by the FBI, reaches its second highest peak ever."
1992: The Los Angeles race riot breaks out in response to “not guilty” verdicts given to officers who were videotaped beating motorist
"Rodney King. This riot, the most severe civil disorder in U.S. history, claims 55 dead and one billion dollars in property damage."
1993-2001: The FBI reports declines in violent crime rates as the U.S. economy improves. Violent crime among African-Americans
"declines by 60%, paralleling declines in black unemployment and poverty. However, the number of persons incarcerated for violent"
crimes (and crime in general) continues to increase. The adult drug arrest rate continues to grow.
1994-1995: Arrests of juveniles for violent crimes reach a 25-year high and declines thereafter.
1996-1998: Increase in the reporting of violent crimes by whites (1996) and then blacks (1998);
"1996-2008: Between 1996 and 2008 there were 39 school shootings in the U.S., each resulting in the death of at least one person."
Federal Government Response
1994: The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act funds Community Oriented Policing (COPS) grants intended to create
"100,000 new police positions including crime prevention and SRO positions. It also includes the Violence Against Women Act,"
"funds Local Law Enforcement Block Grants, Byrne Memorial grants and OJJDP grants to expand crime prevention, anti-drug and"
anti-violence programs (especially programs addressing violence against women).
2000: Congress passes the Protecting Seniors from Fraud Act which expands the national TRIAD program.
Virginia’s Response
1991: DCJS conducts the Convenience Store Crime Study on behalf of the Virginia State Crime Commission.
1992: The Virginia Department of Education contracts with VCPA to conduct school safety assessments (DCJS grant). The City
"of Richmond is selected as a demonstration site for the U.S. DOJ’s Weed and Seed program. Eventually, eight Virginia cities receive"
Weed and Seed funds.
"1993: DCJS report “Analysis of Crimes, Criminals and Cost of Violent Crimes in Convenience Stores, House Document 30. Precursor of"
National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health Administration study of late night retail crime.
1993: Virginia is among the first states to establish legislatively a certification program for Crime Prevention Specialists and among
"the first to have a line-item in the state budget ($100,000) for statewide crime prevention services (since replaced by state or federal"
grants).

2001 to 2008: Events and Governmental Response
"2001: The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 result in a reassessment of the role local law enforcement should play in homeland"
security.
2002: Violent crime rates reach their lowest point in 30 years.
2007: The killing of 32 people at Virginia Tech by a lone gunman who committed suicide results in recommendations for a national
overhaul of campus security.
Federal Government Response
2002: Safe and Drug Free Schools and Communities Act. The United States Attorney General awards a 1.9 million dollar grant to the
"National Sheriff’s Association to double the number of Neighborhood Watch programs to 15,000."
2003: The Protect Act of 2003 provides federal funding to prevent child abuse. “Protect” stands for “Prosecutorial Remedies and
Other Tools to end the Exploitation of Children Today.”
2004: The Justice for All Act provides funding for victims of crime and for DNA testing.
2005: The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announces the Buffer Zone Protection Program to assist state and local
governments to secure critical infrastructure and resource sites.
2006: The Project Safe Neighborhoods Act provides funding for gang prevention and suppression activities and tougher anti-gun
"crime programs. DHS announces the availability of 1.7 billion dollars for state homeland security programs and training, urban areas"
"security initiatives, law enforcement terrorism prevention programs and the Citizen Corps Program."
Virginia’s Response
"2000: Using state funds, DCJS begins awarding grants for the establishment of new SRO positions."
2001: The DCJS Crime Prevention Center (CPC) establishes the Certified Crime Prevention Community Program (CCPC)
The DCJS Certified Crime Prevention Community Program (CCPC)
The CCPC recognizes and certifies localities that have demonstrated a commitment to safety by meeting twelve “core” elements and
"at least seven “optional” elements and, thereby, establishing a comprehensive community safety/crime prevention effort. Believed"
"to be the only one of its kind nationally, the CCPC encourages localities to develop and implement collaborative community safety"
"plans within a flexible framework. Furthermore, it provides an ongoing process by which communities can reassess and update their"
safety/crime prevention plans to address emerging issues. The certification gives CCPC localities preference in the state criminal
justice grant application process and has been used to foster economic development and to bolster a locality’s application for the All
American Cities designation.
The Crime Prevention Center staff provides step-by-step guidance and technical assistance to communities seeking initial certification
or subsequent re-certification. The certification process is rigorous and requires detailed documentation and verification of compliance
"for each element. A subcommittee presents nominations to the Virginia Criminal Justice Services Board (CJSB), which makes the"
"final determination of award. Localities which have earned the designation “Certified Crime Prevention Community” as of May 30,"
"2008 are the cities of Bristol, Galax, Hampton, Lynchburg, Newport News, Portsmouth, Radford, Roanoke and Virginia Beach; the"
"counties of Fairfax, Hanover, Henrico and Prince William, and the town of Herndon. Over 30% of Virginia’s population resides in"
CCPC certified communities.
2001: Virginia is the first state to establish a legislatively mandated Virginia Center for School Safety (VCSS) within the Department
of Criminal Justice Services.
"10	 The OAG also promotes crime prevention through its partnerships and programs on domestic violence, family internet safety, and"
"methamphetamines addiction, law enforcement mentoring to at-risk youth, etc."
Page 9
The Virginia Center for School Safety (VCSS)
"The VCSS’ mission is to improve safety and security in primary, secondary and post-secondary learning institutions. VCSS’s primary"
role in crime prevention is in its training of SROs and in its newly mandated (2005) responsibility for the conduct of annual school
security assessments (audits). A 2007 study found that 574 SROs were providing crime prevention services in 95% of high schools
"and 74% of its middle schools. SROs intervene in student conflicts before they evolve into criminal incidents, monitor school-based"
"anonymous crime-reporting programs, instruct law-related education classes and assist in anti-truancy, anti-drop out, anti-bullying and"
anti-gang programs. In addition they serve as role models and mentors who demonstrate the art of anger and conflict management. In
"conducting annual school security audits, VCSS staff encourages the upgrade of school security and safety policies, the use of CPTED"
"principles in the building or renovation of schools, and the standardization of school-based crime reporting."
VCSS also partners with the Virginia Department of Education and the University of Virginia in the conduct of the Virginia High
"School Safety Study, an ongoing research project that evaluates the effectiveness of school discipline practices and crime prevention efforts"
"that rely on supportive relationships with students. For more information, visit the VCSS website: www.dcjs.virginia.gov/vcss/."
2003: Virginia is recognized for the second time by the National Crime Prevention Council as having the best state level crime
prevention program in the United States. DCJS updates an earlier VCPA publication by issuing a new research-based report “The
"Status of Neighborhood Watch in Virginia,” Virginia Crime Prevention Center, March, 2003. DCJS’ SRO grant program peaks."
"At its peak in FY 2003, DCJS awarded federal funds that supported 93 new SRO positions and state funds that supported 46 SRO"
"positions. By FY 2007, federal funds supported 1 SRO position and state funds supported 34 SRO positions. Most localities assumed"
"the on-going costs of their grant initiated SRO positions, now recognized and appreciated as a modern necessity."
2003: Virginia Attorney General announces that the City of Richmond has been named by OJJDP as one of four demonstration sites
for its new Gang Reduction and Intervention Program (GRIP).
The Attorney General’s Anti-Gang Program (GRIP)
"Richmond GRIP, funded by a $2.5 million OJJDP grant, is a collaborative partnership between federal, state, community, non-profit,"
"for-profit, faith-based and community organizations. It provides coordinated access to private and public services for the families of"
at-risk and/or high-risk youth within the boundaries of two high-crime police beats in the City of Richmond.
The program’s goal is to identify at-risk youth before they become involved in gang activity and link the youths and their families to
services to strengthen the family unit and/or refer youth to recreational options that will lessen the attractiveness of the gang activity.
"To date, GRIP administrators have funded over 50 programs and seen a decrease in crime in the program’s target area. Because of its"
"success, GRIP is being replicated elsewhere in Richmond and is being considered for implementation by other localities."
2003: The Virginia State Police (VSP) creates a cadre of Certified Crime Prevention Specialists.
The Virginia State Police Crime Prevention Specialist Program
"VSP provides selected troopers with training in CPTED, business security, personal safety, workplace violence, crimes against"
"children, crime prevention for senior citizens and travel safety. This training is part of an intensified crime prevention curriculum that"
enables them to achieve DCJS certification as Crime Prevention Specialists (CPS). VSP’s Crime Prevention Coordinator serves as a
"CP instructor, helps fill trooper CP positions, responds to requests for crime prevention services, records departmental CP activity,"
and works to keep the 120-plus crime prevention staff qualified as certified CPSs.11 Trooper-CPSs now account for 30% of all active
CPSs with at least one assigned to each of 48 sub-division areas.
"Trooper CPSs normally devote an estimated 10% of their work time to crime prevention, although this varies by geographical"
"location. 12 They assess the environmental/physical security of highway rest areas, perform security assessments for businesses and"
"citizens, hand out CP literature, and deliver crime prevention talks or presentations. They may also attend regional CP meetings, work"
with local TRIAD groups and participate in school safety audits.
Two crime prevention services are unique to trooper-CPSs: the Virginia Judicial Security Initiative (VJSI) and the General Aviation
"Security Initiative (GASI). VJSI, coordinated through the OAG and the Virginia Center for Policing Innovation (VCPI), provides"
"specially trained trooper-CPSs to join with others in assessing the security of courthouses and, if requested, private residences of"
"judges. Since its inception (2005), an estimated 34 courthouses have been assessed. GASI is directed by the Virginia Department of"
"11	 The current Coordinator, Sgt. Lars Hermann is on the staff of the VSP Training Academy in Richmond, Virginia. He may be contacted at (804)"
674-4632.

Aviation (VDOA) and requires trooper-CPSs to assess the physical/environmental security of Virginia’s 58 small public and private
"airports. Twenty-nine (29) trooper-CPSs were specially trained to conduct these assessments. Since November 2006, 24 airports have"
been assessed and airport officials have been apprised of how well their facilities match up with federally endorsed airport security
practices and enhancements.
"VSP also provides crime prevention services through its Help Eliminate Auto Theft (HEAT) Program, Insurance Fraud Division,"
"High Technology Crimes Unit, Gang Unit, and Sex Offender Registry Program."
2006: The General Assembly creates the Office of Campus Policing and Security (OCPS).
The DCJS Office of Campus Policing and Security (OCPS)
"OCPS is housed within DCJS and is responsible, among other duties, for developing and maintaining a strong crime prevention"
"posture on Virginia’s campuses. The OCPS is currently assigned to the VCSS, where staff is gathering detailed information about the"
crime prevention staffing and activities at each campus and are working with experts in the field to develop employment and training
criteria for Campus Security Officers.
"2006: VCPA organizes one of the nation’s first statewide interdisciplinary “Safer By Design” coalitions, a group of local and state"
"leaders in law enforcement, community planning, architecture, landscape design, fire safety, and building code regulations, whose"
"purpose is to advocate for the use of CPTED principles in building, landscape, and greenways design."
2007: Virginia becomes the first state to mandate that public school officials integrate internet safety lessons into the daily curriculum
of students at all grade levels.13
The Impact of Federal Funding: 1997-2008
It is generally acknowledged that many of the crime prevention milestones of this period came about as a result of the availability of
federal funds to establish specific programs. More difficult to discern is the influence federal monies have had on state and local agencies.
"Records for federal crime prevention funds granted before 1996 are no longer accessible and, thus, early Law Enforcement Assistance"
"Administration (LEAA), Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP), “Weed and Seed” and Community Oriented"
"Policing (COP) grant records could not be examined. Post-1996 grant records, however, provide some worthwhile insights."
"DCJS serves as the primary distributor of federal justice assistance funds to Virginia localities and state agencies, except for those"
"awarded directly to localities by a federal agency. Consequently, recent DCJS records were examined to find out who received federal"
monies for crime prevention programming. Except for approximately $1.6 million dollars of recent Law Enforcement Terrorism
"Prevention Program (LETPP) grant money for anti-terrorism (not purely crime prevention) training, all of the DCJS-awarded federal"
crime prevention funds (not including SRO funds14) came from the Edward R. Byrne Memorial Grant Program (Byrne).
Byrne Crime Prevention Grants: 1996-2008
"Between 1996 and 2008, DCJS awarded almost $91 million dollars in Byrne funds to Virginia’s state and local law enforcement"
agencies. An estimated 9.6% of this money ($8.6 million) went for crime prevention programming.15 Table 3 lists the types of agencies
that received this money and the amounts they received. Table 4 shows the types of CP programs funded (based on grant application
"titles), with columns 2 and 3 showing the figures for both state and local recipients and columns 4 and 5 showing the figures for local"
"agencies. Fifty-four percent (54%) of Byrne crime prevention funds ($4,637,332 of a total of $8,602,709) was awarded to city, county,"
"and town agencies. Forty-one percent (41%) went to 26 city, county and town police departments and 16 city and county sheriff ’s"
"offices (total of $3,525,382). Table 5 ranks these localities on the basis of Byrne crime prevention money received."
"12	 Troopers in Central Virginia (Division 1) and Tidewater Virginia (Division 5), two of three heavily populated divisions, dedicate more time"
because demand for crime prevention services is high in these areas and local law enforcement agencies lack sufficient crime prevention resources.
"This contrasts with the other highly populous division (Northern Virginia/Division 7), where local law enforcement agencies (especially Fairfax"
"County, Arlington County and Alexandria City PDs) are relatively rich in CP staff and resources. Trooper-CPSs in rural areas may also devote"
more time to crime prevention because rural law enforcement agencies often have fewer crime prevention resources.
"13	 These points, and 15 others presented in Appendix C, are based on a detailed timeline created by Pat Harris, Executive Director of Virginia"
Crime Prevention Association (VCPA). The VCPA timeline may be accessed at www.vcpa.org.
"14	 Our analysis separates SRO funding from that used entirely for crime prevention purposes (CPTED, CPS training, Neighborhood Watch, etc.)."
SROs are considered crime prevention practitioners yet they also act as law enforcers.

survey of Virginia law enforcement chief executives (CEOs). The surveys generated information on:22,
•,"Crime prevention staffing,"
•,"How agencies are organized to provide crime prevention services,"
•,"CP-specific funding,"
•,"Different types of programs,"
•,"The use of citizen coalitions,"
•,"What programs are most active and effective,"
•,"What programs are new,"
•,"What programs should be given more focus or attention,"
•,"The extent to which requests for services changed after the terrorist attacks of 9-11-2001,"
•,"The extent to which practitioners have had anti-terrorism training and been involved in simulated terrorist attacks, and"
•,What CP practitioners and CEOs view as the most important thing we can do to improve Virginia’s crime prevention efforts.
Survey Methodology,
"Invitations to complete the online surveys were sent to DCJS-certified CPSs and Virginia police chiefs and sheriffs.23 Once online,","Invitations to complete the online surveys were sent to DCJS-certified CPSs and Virginia police chiefs and sheriffs.23 Once online,"
respondents were asked if they were “specialists” or “CEOs” and were then guided to the appropriate set of questions. Some questions,respondents were asked if they were “specialists” or “CEOs” and were then guided to the appropriate set of questions. Some questions
were asked of both groups.,
•,Response Rates: Fifty-eight percent (n=176) of the 306 Chiefs and Sheriffs (CEOs) invited to take the survey responded. A
,response rate for CP practitioners was not calculated for lack of an accurate base number. Invitations were sent to DCJS-certified
,"Crime Prevention Specialists (CPS) listed in a DCJS file. In addition, Chiefs and Sheriffs were asked to have their CP practitioners"
,"take the survey, yet there was no way of knowing how many persons they asked. Seventy-seven percent (77%) of the 241 CP"
,practitioners who responded had up-to-date CPS certifications.
•,Strengths and Limitations of the Data: The degree to which our findings reflect the state of crime prevention in the Commonwealth
,as a whole is enhanced by the fact that the combined populations of the localities represented in each sample constituted a high
,percentage of Virginia’s total 2006 population (84%: practitioner sample and 82%: CEO sample). Data validity and reliability are
,limited somewhat because practitioners or CEOs from several large and many smaller law enforcement agencies did not respond.
,"It is also limited to the extent that respondents differed in their knowledge about local crime prevention programming, that is, to"
,the extent they inadvertently provided conflicting or erroneous information.
•,Making Comparable Samples: Locality Crime Prevention Specialists and Locality CEOs: The survey respondents were
,employed by different types of law enforcement agencies with the majority working for local police departments or sheriffs’
,"offices. Others worked for campus police departments, the Virginia State Police, various public authorities (e.g. airport, housing)"
,"or state agencies that have specialized security forces (e.g. VDOT, ABC, DGIF). Table 7 identifies the practitioners and CEOs"
,according to the type of agency they worked for.

Summary and Comments
Virginia History
Virginia’s law enforcement officials were among the nation’s first to advance crime prevention programming as a response to the
crime trends and social unrest of the past 30 or 40 years. The timeline of crime prevention milestones shows Virginia to be a leader
"in the development of Neighborhood Watch, the application of Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED)"
"principles, implementation of community-oriented policing strategy, TRIAD programming, the use of SROs in secondary schools,"
the development of internet crime policies and use of Citizen Police Academies.
Virginia’s state and local officials have made crime prevention an institutionalized component of the Commonwealth’s approach to law
enforcement. This is evidenced by the fact that Virginia:
"(1) was among the first states (1977) to hire state-level employees whose only function was to promote crime prevention, first to"
"establish (1989) a state-level crime prevention unit (the Department of Criminal Justice Service’s Crime Prevention Section), and"
"first (1994) to create and staff a legislatively mandated (§ 9.1-158) state-level Crime Prevention Center (CPC). In 2001, the CPC"
was the first to create a state-administered Certified Crime Prevention Community Program that recognizes localities that have
implemented a wide range of community crime prevention initiatives.
"(2) was among the first states (1978) to establish a private, non-profit organization (the Virginia Crime Prevention Association"
"(VCPA)) whose mission was to partner with public and private organizations to provide CP training, initiate development of"
new crime prevention programs (such as VCPA’s work with public housing authorities) and organize new crime prevention
"organizations. For example, VCPA helped to establish five regional crime prevention associations and one of the nation’s first"
"statewide interdisciplinary “Safer By Design” coalitions, a group that advocates the use of CPTED principles in building, landscape,"
and greenways design.
(3) 	has a cadre of at least 400 crime prevention practitioners who create and maintain local programs. Virginia’s officials have bolstered
the professional stature of these practitioners through the DCJS Certified Crime Prevention Specialist (CPS) program (1989)
"and continue to do so. One of the first of its kind in the nation, the CPS program provides state of the art training in all aspects of"
"crime prevention including CPTED, terrorist threat assessment, and crime analysis."
"(4)	 has been a national leader in the placement of SROs (sworn officers) in primary and secondary schools. Today, there are nearly 600"
"SROs in Virginia’s high schools and middle schools, the great majority of whom have received training through the legislatively"
"established Virginia Center for School Safety (2001), an entity housed within the DCJS. SROs provide daily crime prevention"
services to a large percentage of Virginia’s most crime-prone population cohort. Virginia is also one of the first states (2006) to
"establish a state-level entity to monitor and guide crime prevention efforts on its college and university campuses, the Office of"
Campus Policing and Security (OCPS).
"Virginia has also taken advantage of the many federal funding streams that address crime and crime prevention. For example, Virginia"
"has used federal dollars from the National Sheriffs’ Association to bolster its Neighborhood Watch programs, U.S. Attorney’s Office"
"(DOJ) funds to establish “weed and seed,” TRIAD, Class Action, GREAT and GRIP programs, COPS money to establish community"
"policing, crime prevention and SRO positions, federal Edward R. Byrne Memorial and Safe and Drug Free Schools/Communities"
"monies to fund more SRO positions, and Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Program and other DHS funds to teach law"
enforcement officers how to prevent and combat terrorism.
"As the timeline of crime prevention milestones suggests, Virginia has had the advantage of strong statewide leadership from the DCJS"
Crime Prevention Center and the Virginia Crime Prevention Association. From the state’s early initiatives on Neighborhood Watch
and the application of CPTED principles to its development of certification programs for Crime Prevention Specialists and Certified
"Crime Prevention Communities, these entities have kept Virginia on the cutting edge of the discipline."
"One concern revealed by the historical data, however, is the relatively small amount of state funding devoted to crime prevention."
Other than appropriations to create new SRO positions 31 and funds appropriated to the Virginia Crime Prevention Association to
"conduct training, state funding is mainly supplied to maintain the DCJS Crime Prevention Center."
31	 Only 30 such positions are being funded during FY2008-2009.
Page 31
"The biggest concern to CP advocates at the current time is the problem of shrinking public budgets. In April of 2008, the Governor"
announced a shortfall in state revenue receipts that led him to order a state hiring freeze and a curtailment of other expenses. The
"economic downturn is also restricting the supply of federal monies. Consequently, towards the end of FY 2008, the Virginia Crime"
Prevention Association faced the possibility of no longer receiving the funds it relies upon for its operations.
Survey Findings
"The survey of agency CEOs and crime prevention practitioners provided detailed information on local CP efforts, information that"
revealed the strengths and weaknesses of these efforts.
Crime Prevention Strengths:
The strength of Virginia’s crime prevention efforts can be seen in the large and growing number of CP practitioners and programs.
"We estimate that about 400 law enforcement personnel are administering crime prevention services on a daily basis. In addition, 71%"
"of 90 agencies represented in the Specialist sample had created new or revived 148 local programs in the past five years, an average of"
2.3 such programs per agency. Strength is also reflected in the long and diverse list of active programs catalogued in Appendix A. The
many locality-specific programs on this list manifest the creativity these agencies apply as they address local crime prevention needs.
The survey also revealed broad support for increasing Virginia’s CP resources and organizational capacity. When asked what they
"would do to improve Virginia’s effort, the most frequent suggestions by CEOs and Specialists were to increase staff, allow more time"
"for existing staff to establish programs and deliver services, and to improve the quality of staff training. In addition, there were many"
"recommendations to establish more CPUs, improve cross-jurisdictional cooperation and facilitate the integration of crime prevention"
strategies within community policing operations.
Other indicators of strength were the findings that 70% of agency CEOs said their CP practitioners had attended anti-terrorism
"training, 71% of the 90 agencies represented in the Specialist sample reported new or revitalized crime prevention programs in the"
"past five years, and 68% or more of these 90 agencies had active SRO, CP material distribution, SRO taught Law-Related Education,"
Neighborhood Watch and Crimesolvers programs.
Crime Prevention Weaknesses
The survey did not address the question of weaknesses in agency-directed crime prevention efforts per se because there was no set of
"expectations or assumptions about these efforts prior to our research. Several weaknesses can be inferred, however, from the difficulties"
"respondents had in answering certain questions. For example, less than half of the 48 agency CEOs who reported crime prevention"
"discretionary funds could provide estimates of these funds. Apparently crime prevention budgets, and especially discretionary CP"
"funds, are not, as yet, an institutionalized component of local crime prevention efforts."
Other weaknesses were evident in the difficulties Specialists had in determining how active their agencies’ programs were or whether
"some were “more effective” than others. As noted in the text, these findings indicate a lack of precision with regard to standards of CP"
"program implementation and measures of program activity and performance. If this is not addressed, the institutionalization of the"
crime prevention function within law enforcement agencies may be limited.
The Future of Crime Prevention in Virginia
This report presents a snapshot of agency-directed crime prevention efforts in the Commonwealth. It identifies a baseline of crime
"prevention practices that, we hope, will enable CP advocates to learn and work from a statewide perspective when assessing these"
"practices. We also hope that it contributes to and encourages a dialog on the need for crime prevention program standards. Ideally, it"
will advance the idea that the mission of crime prevention should be embedded in all levels and types of Virginia policy-making.
We are presently faced with a budget crisis that will most likely prevent any dramatic further advances in agency CP programming.
No new federal funding streams are anticipated and those that exist are unlikely to grow in size. With both the federal government and
"the Commonwealth facing revenue shortages, the future is unclear. For these reasons, however, a statewide perspective may help to"
"identify areas, programs or initiatives which can be advanced without major budget impacts."
Much can be done without additional resources. Many of the survey respondents called for the preservation of progress already made
and suggested that the natural next step was to increase the integrity and uniformity of programs already established.
"Although a great variety of programs exists to accomplish the many tasks crime prevention experts have identified, a process is needed"
"to identify those that are most cost efficient, that make citizens and property owners feel safe, and that produce measurable reductions"
in crime. The way to do this is to: (1) develop and advance model policies and programs; (2) encourage uniformity in program
implementation: and (3) verify and validate model programs based on the goals and objectives they have been designed to achieve.
Page 32
Very little empirical research has been done that compares crime prevention programs agency-to-agency or region-to-region in
"Virginia. Although federal grants require recipients to establish program goals and measurable objectives, it is not clear if this exercise"
continues when federal funding ends.
What seems apparent is the need for all stakeholders to come together in a collaborative fashion to address these issues and to lay out
"a plan for the advancement of crime prevention in the Commonwealth. Such an effort must include police chiefs and sheriffs, their"
"crime prevention specialists, and others from local government such as zoning officials, and city and county planners. Architects,"
"developers, and builders, as well as the academic experts on crime prevention need to be at the table as well. The not-for-profit Virginia"
"Crime Prevention Association and State government’s Crime Prevention Center have great experience and expertise to lend, and are"
the logical organizations to coordinate such an effort.

ABC’s 130 Special Agents and staff are primarily tasked with the enforcement of laws and regulations dealing with the consumption and
"distribution of alcohol. Coincidentally, they administer programs designed to prevent alcohol abuse and reduce its illegal distribution."
Each of ABCs nine regional or satellite offices offers a Speaker Bureau whereby ABC agents can be called upon to deliver alcohol
awareness programs to groups and organizations in the local community. ABC also sponsors an annual ABC College Conference for
college student leaders and a summer week-long program for high-school leaders called the Youth Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention
"Project (YADAPP). In addition to promoting responsibility in the use of alcohol, both events offer workshops about the danger of"
illegal drugs and violence prevention.
ABC has recently unveiled a new program titled the Alcohol and Aging Awareness Group (AAAG). This program recognizes that
"alcohol abuse is a growing problem facing older Americans. Created in response to a recent act of the General Assembly, AAAG"
enables its licensees to educate ABC customers and caregivers about alcohol misuse among Virginia’s aging population. Call 213-4445
for information.
The Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT)
"Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, VDOT security personnel have adopted a number of proactive crime prevention"
strategies to secure Virginia’s land transportation infrastructure. Staff have installed electronic gates to control traffic on evacuation
"routes, implemented a statewide unified “smart card” identification and access control system, conducted additional background"
"checks on VDOT staff and contractors working at critical infrastructure sites, installed security cameras, and conducted comprehensive"
security assessments at all VDOT critical facilities.
"In addition, VDOT security personnel participate in homeland security exercises, and work with VSP and disaster preparedness"
"agencies on plans to prevent or control chemical, biological or nuclear attacks. They also worked with VSP to enhance security during"
the recent celebrations of the Jamestown Colony’s 400th anniversary. The VDOT Operations and Security Division is staffed by
approximately 30 personnel.

The Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries (VGIF)
In recent years DGIF officials have helped to establish seven Wildlife Crime Watches (WCW). A WCW is a group of concerned
citizens who partner with law enforcement officials (Conservation Officers) to protect game and wildlife and assist in the enforcement
of game and wildlife laws. Road signs announcing the Watches’ areas as “Wildlife Crime Watch Areas” are placed in participating
communities and watch members utilize phone trees to verify and report suspicious or illegal activities. Members have assisted in the
"prevention of spotlighting, killing bears out of season, stealing water craft, road hunting and illegal trespassing. WCW chapters are"
concentrated in Buchanan and Shenandoah counties with more being organized in other parts of Virginia. Those interested should
contact the game warden located in their area.
Henrico County Division of Police (HCDP)
The Henrico County Division of Police (HCDP) deserves special recognition because of the extraordinarily high number of certified
crime prevention specialists on its staff. CPS certification is encouraged for the employees (sworn and civilian) within the Community
"Policing Unit and School Services Unit. Forty-three (43) Division personnel who serve either as SRO, DARE, Community Policing and"
Crime Prevention Officers or as civilian staff in the crime prevention section are DCJS certified CPSs (13% of the current active total).
"HCDP’s Community Policing Unit offers formal programming in 12 areas: CPTED, Violence in the Workplace Seminars, Business"
"and Residential Security and Lighting Seminars, Neighborhood Watch, Crime Prevention and Safety, Personal Safety, Robbery, Rape"
"and Shoplifting Prevention, Pedestrian Safety, Fraud and Con Crime Prevention and Home Security. For more information, visit"
