Context of Law Enforcement-Based Crime Prevention Efforts,
There are at least five crime prevention strategies:,
1.,Socio-economic prevention: Governmental policies/programs that ameliorate the broader causal conditions of crime such as
,"poverty, unemployment, family disintegration, poor educational resources, inadequate parenting, neighborhood blight, social"
,"discontent, etc."
2.,Socialization-prevention: Programs that help “at-risk” juveniles overcome the effects of the aforementioned conditions so they’re
,"not as easily drawn to criminal activity. These programs include mentoring, tutoring, after-school programming, truancy and"
,"drop out prevention, character and legal education, job training, drug awareness, etc."
3.,Incapacitation-prevention: Prosecutorial and judicial policies that confine offenders as a way to prevent their further involvement
,in public criminal behavior.
4.,Rehabilitation-prevention: Treatment programs to help legally sanctioned offenders or other at-risk individuals avoid future
,"criminal behavior. Modalities include juvenile and adult probation, drug treatment, mental health treatment, job training,"
,"character education, offender re-entry programs, and others."
5.,"Deterrence-prevention: Programs/policies that create and maintain a humane, just, and effective criminal justice system and those"
,"that attempt to increase the physical and psychological costs of criminal behavior. These include target hardening strategies,"
,"establishment of neighborhood and business crime watch groups, use of School Resource Officers (SROs) in middle and high"
,schools and the training of citizens to make them more aware of criminal activity and how to avoid being victimized.
