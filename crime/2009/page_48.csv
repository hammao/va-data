The Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries (VGIF)
In recent years DGIF officials have helped to establish seven Wildlife Crime Watches (WCW). A WCW is a group of concerned
citizens who partner with law enforcement officials (Conservation Officers) to protect game and wildlife and assist in the enforcement
of game and wildlife laws. Road signs announcing the Watches’ areas as “Wildlife Crime Watch Areas” are placed in participating
communities and watch members utilize phone trees to verify and report suspicious or illegal activities. Members have assisted in the
"prevention of spotlighting, killing bears out of season, stealing water craft, road hunting and illegal trespassing. WCW chapters are"
concentrated in Buchanan and Shenandoah counties with more being organized in other parts of Virginia. Those interested should
contact the game warden located in their area.
Henrico County Division of Police (HCDP)
The Henrico County Division of Police (HCDP) deserves special recognition because of the extraordinarily high number of certified
crime prevention specialists on its staff. CPS certification is encouraged for the employees (sworn and civilian) within the Community
"Policing Unit and School Services Unit. Forty-three (43) Division personnel who serve either as SRO, DARE, Community Policing and"
Crime Prevention Officers or as civilian staff in the crime prevention section are DCJS certified CPSs (13% of the current active total).
"HCDP’s Community Policing Unit offers formal programming in 12 areas: CPTED, Violence in the Workplace Seminars, Business"
"and Residential Security and Lighting Seminars, Neighborhood Watch, Crime Prevention and Safety, Personal Safety, Robbery, Rape"
"and Shoplifting Prevention, Pedestrian Safety, Fraud and Con Crime Prevention and Home Security. For more information, visit"
