Aviation (VDOA) and requires trooper-CPSs to assess the physical/environmental security of Virginia’s 58 small public and private
"airports. Twenty-nine (29) trooper-CPSs were specially trained to conduct these assessments. Since November 2006, 24 airports have"
been assessed and airport officials have been apprised of how well their facilities match up with federally endorsed airport security
practices and enhancements.
"VSP also provides crime prevention services through its Help Eliminate Auto Theft (HEAT) Program, Insurance Fraud Division,"
"High Technology Crimes Unit, Gang Unit, and Sex Offender Registry Program."
2006: The General Assembly creates the Office of Campus Policing and Security (OCPS).
The DCJS Office of Campus Policing and Security (OCPS)
"OCPS is housed within DCJS and is responsible, among other duties, for developing and maintaining a strong crime prevention"
"posture on Virginia’s campuses. The OCPS is currently assigned to the VCSS, where staff is gathering detailed information about the"
crime prevention staffing and activities at each campus and are working with experts in the field to develop employment and training
criteria for Campus Security Officers.
"2006: VCPA organizes one of the nation’s first statewide interdisciplinary “Safer By Design” coalitions, a group of local and state"
"leaders in law enforcement, community planning, architecture, landscape design, fire safety, and building code regulations, whose"
"purpose is to advocate for the use of CPTED principles in building, landscape, and greenways design."
2007: Virginia becomes the first state to mandate that public school officials integrate internet safety lessons into the daily curriculum
of students at all grade levels.13
The Impact of Federal Funding: 1997-2008
It is generally acknowledged that many of the crime prevention milestones of this period came about as a result of the availability of
federal funds to establish specific programs. More difficult to discern is the influence federal monies have had on state and local agencies.
"Records for federal crime prevention funds granted before 1996 are no longer accessible and, thus, early Law Enforcement Assistance"
"Administration (LEAA), Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP), “Weed and Seed” and Community Oriented"
"Policing (COP) grant records could not be examined. Post-1996 grant records, however, provide some worthwhile insights."
"DCJS serves as the primary distributor of federal justice assistance funds to Virginia localities and state agencies, except for those"
"awarded directly to localities by a federal agency. Consequently, recent DCJS records were examined to find out who received federal"
monies for crime prevention programming. Except for approximately $1.6 million dollars of recent Law Enforcement Terrorism
"Prevention Program (LETPP) grant money for anti-terrorism (not purely crime prevention) training, all of the DCJS-awarded federal"
crime prevention funds (not including SRO funds14) came from the Edward R. Byrne Memorial Grant Program (Byrne).
Byrne Crime Prevention Grants: 1996-2008
"Between 1996 and 2008, DCJS awarded almost $91 million dollars in Byrne funds to Virginia’s state and local law enforcement"
agencies. An estimated 9.6% of this money ($8.6 million) went for crime prevention programming.15 Table 3 lists the types of agencies
that received this money and the amounts they received. Table 4 shows the types of CP programs funded (based on grant application
"titles), with columns 2 and 3 showing the figures for both state and local recipients and columns 4 and 5 showing the figures for local"
"agencies. Fifty-four percent (54%) of Byrne crime prevention funds ($4,637,332 of a total of $8,602,709) was awarded to city, county,"
"and town agencies. Forty-one percent (41%) went to 26 city, county and town police departments and 16 city and county sheriff ’s"
"offices (total of $3,525,382). Table 5 ranks these localities on the basis of Byrne crime prevention money received."
"12	 Troopers in Central Virginia (Division 1) and Tidewater Virginia (Division 5), two of three heavily populated divisions, dedicate more time"
because demand for crime prevention services is high in these areas and local law enforcement agencies lack sufficient crime prevention resources.
"This contrasts with the other highly populous division (Northern Virginia/Division 7), where local law enforcement agencies (especially Fairfax"
"County, Arlington County and Alexandria City PDs) are relatively rich in CP staff and resources. Trooper-CPSs in rural areas may also devote"
more time to crime prevention because rural law enforcement agencies often have fewer crime prevention resources.
"13	 These points, and 15 others presented in Appendix C, are based on a detailed timeline created by Pat Harris, Executive Director of Virginia"
Crime Prevention Association (VCPA). The VCPA timeline may be accessed at www.vcpa.org.
"14	 Our analysis separates SRO funding from that used entirely for crime prevention purposes (CPTED, CPS training, Neighborhood Watch, etc.)."
SROs are considered crime prevention practitioners yet they also act as law enforcers.
