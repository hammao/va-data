survey of Virginia law enforcement chief executives (CEOs). The surveys generated information on:22,
•,"Crime prevention staffing,"
•,"How agencies are organized to provide crime prevention services,"
•,"CP-specific funding,"
•,"Different types of programs,"
•,"The use of citizen coalitions,"
•,"What programs are most active and effective,"
•,"What programs are new,"
•,"What programs should be given more focus or attention,"
•,"The extent to which requests for services changed after the terrorist attacks of 9-11-2001,"
•,"The extent to which practitioners have had anti-terrorism training and been involved in simulated terrorist attacks, and"
•,What CP practitioners and CEOs view as the most important thing we can do to improve Virginia’s crime prevention efforts.
Survey Methodology,
"Invitations to complete the online surveys were sent to DCJS-certified CPSs and Virginia police chiefs and sheriffs.23 Once online,","Invitations to complete the online surveys were sent to DCJS-certified CPSs and Virginia police chiefs and sheriffs.23 Once online,"
respondents were asked if they were “specialists” or “CEOs” and were then guided to the appropriate set of questions. Some questions,respondents were asked if they were “specialists” or “CEOs” and were then guided to the appropriate set of questions. Some questions
were asked of both groups.,
•,Response Rates: Fifty-eight percent (n=176) of the 306 Chiefs and Sheriffs (CEOs) invited to take the survey responded. A
,response rate for CP practitioners was not calculated for lack of an accurate base number. Invitations were sent to DCJS-certified
,"Crime Prevention Specialists (CPS) listed in a DCJS file. In addition, Chiefs and Sheriffs were asked to have their CP practitioners"
,"take the survey, yet there was no way of knowing how many persons they asked. Seventy-seven percent (77%) of the 241 CP"
,practitioners who responded had up-to-date CPS certifications.
•,Strengths and Limitations of the Data: The degree to which our findings reflect the state of crime prevention in the Commonwealth
,as a whole is enhanced by the fact that the combined populations of the localities represented in each sample constituted a high
,percentage of Virginia’s total 2006 population (84%: practitioner sample and 82%: CEO sample). Data validity and reliability are
,limited somewhat because practitioners or CEOs from several large and many smaller law enforcement agencies did not respond.
,"It is also limited to the extent that respondents differed in their knowledge about local crime prevention programming, that is, to"
,the extent they inadvertently provided conflicting or erroneous information.
•,Making Comparable Samples: Locality Crime Prevention Specialists and Locality CEOs: The survey respondents were
,employed by different types of law enforcement agencies with the majority working for local police departments or sheriffs’
,"offices. Others worked for campus police departments, the Virginia State Police, various public authorities (e.g. airport, housing)"
,"or state agencies that have specialized security forces (e.g. VDOT, ABC, DGIF). Table 7 identifies the practitioners and CEOs"
,according to the type of agency they worked for.
