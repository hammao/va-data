  Description:
    Abstract: This map layer shows areal and linear water features of the United States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  The original file was produced by joining the individual State hydrography layers from the 1:2,000,000-scale Digital Line Graph (DLG) data produced by the USGS.  This map layer was formerly distributed as Hydrography Features of the United States. This is a revised version of the January 2003 map layer.
    Purpose: These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the national level, and for large regional areas.  The data should be displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:2,000,000-scale data. No responsibility is assumed by the National Atlas of the United States in the use of these data. A subset of the larger dataset is used as basemap information for work in the Chesapeake Bay area.

Data_Quality_Information:
  Logical_Consistency_Report: The map layer was checked for topological consistency using the Arc/INFO command BUILD.  No other checks for logical consistency were performed on this map layer.
  Completeness_Report: The original map layer included water features for all fifty States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  Data completeness generally reflects the content of the original DLG files. The data have been subsequently edited to only include those streams and river that fall within the states of Virginia and Maryland.

      Process_Description:
        The 2MILHY data files were originally digitized by the National Mapping Division based on the sectional maps contained in 'The National Atlas of the United States of America' published by the USGS in 1970.  The
        1:2,000,000-scale Digital Line Graph (DLG) data were merged into a single national water features coverage.  Where necessary to effect the merge, alignment changes were made.  The names were taken from the USGS
        1:100,000-scale maps.  For Alaska, the names were taken from the 1:250,000-scale sheets.  State lines across water bodies were removed from the national coverage.  State attributes were assigned to the features.

      Process_Description:
        Names were researched for approximately 1,200 linear streams, canals, aqueducts, and Intracoastal Waterway instances, in the conterminous United States and Hawaii, that did not have names in ATLASHY0301.  Names
        were determined from the USGS 1:24,000-scale maps; the remaining features without names were not labeled on the 1:24,000-scale maps, or fall in Alaska, or represent dams that have not yet been fully researched.  Features for which no name appears within the source data have a value of "NONE GIVEN" in the Name field.  Features such as shorelines, apparent limits, and closure lines do not have names and have a value of "N/A" in the Name field.  Several name corrections were made.  Minor spatial edits required to accommodate name changes, such as connecting or splitting features, were made as necessary.

      Process_Description: Used ArcCatalog 9.2 to import the text metadata that shipped with the data. The text metadata had to be edited (used Microsoft WordPad version 5.1) to reflect the attribute elements specific to this polyline shapefile, plus add the attribute FID and make all the attribute labels upper-case letters so that the metadata would import correctly. Other minor edits were applied to the metadata - that did not affect the overall content meaning.

      Process_Description: Using ArcMap 9.2, from the properties menu of data layer the following definition query was set: "F_CODE" = 4 AND ("STATE" = 'VA' OR "STATE" = 'MD' OR "STATE" = 'MD-VA'). Essentially, this only displayed the polylines with an F_CODE of 4 (meaning it's a river or stream) and only those polylines that have the STATE attribute of VA, MD or MD-VA. Right mouse click on the data layer and Data - Export Data create a new shapefile based on the polylines that the definition query displays.
