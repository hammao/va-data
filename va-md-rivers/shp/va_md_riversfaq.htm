VA_MD_RIVERS.SHP: Streams and River Polylines that Fall Within Virginia and Maryland Based on the National Atlas Streams and Waterbodies of the United States Dataset

</dd>
<dt><em>Abstract:</em>  
<dd>

This map layer shows areal and linear water features of the United States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  The original file was produced by joining the individual State hydrography layers from the 1:2,000,000-scale Digital Line Graph (DLG) data produced by the USGS.  This map layer was formerly distributed as Hydrography Features of the United States. This is a revised version of the January 2003 map layer.

The 2MILHY data files were originally digitized by the National Mapping Division based on the sectional maps contained in 'The National Atlas of the United States of America' published by the USGS in 1970.  The
1:2,000,000-scale Digital Line Graph (DLG) data were merged into a single national water features coverage.  Where necessary to effect the merge, alignment changes were made.  The names were taken from the USGS
1:100,000-scale maps.  For Alaska, the names were taken from the 1:250,000-scale sheets.  State lines across water bodies were removed from the national coverage.  State attributes were assigned to the features.

Some spatial features were added and corrected.  Some name attributes were added or corrected.  All occurrences of St. were changed to Saint. Extra spaces were removed from the attributes.  Water features for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands were added.

Names were researched for approximately 1,200 linear streams, canals, aqueducts, and Intracoastal Waterway instances, in the conterminous United States and Hawaii, that did not have names in ATLASHY0301.  Names
were determined from the USGS 1:24,000-scale maps; the remaining features without names were not labeled on the 1:24,000-scale maps, or fall in Alaska, or represent dams that have not yet been fully researched.  Features for which no name appears within the source data have a value of &quot;NONE GIVEN&quot; in the Name field.  Features such as shorelines, apparent limits, and closure lines do not have names and have a value of &quot;N/A&quot; in the Name field.  Several name corrections were made.  Minor spatial edits required to accommodate name changes, such as connecting or splitting features, were made as necessary.

Used ArcMap 9.2 to define the spatial reference as Geographic, NAD83 based on the metadata accompanying the dataset: ArcMap 9.2 - ArcToolbox - Data Management Tools - Projections and Transformations - Define Projection. The parameters use: input dataset - hydrogl020.shp; coordinate system - GCS_North_American_1983.

Used ArcCatalog 9.2 to import the text metadata that shipped with the data. The text metadata had to be edited (used Microsoft WordPad version 5.1) to reflect the attribute elements specific to this polyline shapefile, plus add the attribute FID and make all the attribute labels upper-case letters so that the metadata would import correctly. Other minor edits were applied to the metadata - that did not affect the overall content meaning.

Using ArcMap 9.2, from the properties menu of data layer the following definition query was set: &quot;F_CODE&quot; = 4 AND (&quot;STATE&quot; = 'VA' OR &quot;STATE&quot; = 'MD' OR &quot;STATE&quot; = 'MD-VA'). Essentially, this only displayed the polylines with an F_CODE of 4 (meaning it's a river or stream) and only those polylines that have the STATE attribute of VA, MD or MD-VA. Right mouse click on the data layer and Data - Export Data create a new shapefile based on the polylines that the definition query displays.

The original map layer included water features for all fifty States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  Data completeness generally reflects the content of the original DLG files. The data have been subsequently edited to only include those streams and river that fall within the states of Virginia and Maryland.
