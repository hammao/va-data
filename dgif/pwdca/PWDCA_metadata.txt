      Geospatial_Data_Presentation_Form: raster digital data
      Other_Citation_Details: This dataset was funded funded, in part, by the Virginia Coastal Zone Management Program at the Department of Environmental Quality through Grant #FY08 NAO8NOS4190466, Task 11.02 of the U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, under the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972, as amended.

  Description:
    Abstract: The Priority Wildlife Diversity Conservation Areas (PWDCA) dataset was created by the Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries (DGIF) to identify areas important to conservation of nongame wildlife, based on recommendations from DGIF biologists, Virginia's Wildlife Action Plan, and other sources.  This is part of a larger effort to map Priority Conservation Areas in the coastal zone of Virginia through a partnership between DGIF, Department of Conservation and Recreation - Natural Heritage, and Virginia Commonwealth University's Center for Environmental Studies.  The PWDCA highlights areas due to the presence of unfragmented habitat, wetlands, identified habitat for rare species, and/or special wildlife features such as waterbird colonies, designated important bird areas, or anadromous fish use areas.  Areas are also included in the PWDCA if they border these features, providing a minimum protective buffer.  The PWDCA has values from 1-5, with 5 being the highest priority.  The 1-5 values are subjective rankings based on expert opinions.
    Purpose: The PWDCA is a generalized subjective map intended to guide initial conservation planning or green infrastructure efforts.  It does not replace the need for on-the-ground surveys or consultations with biologists, land managers, and planners.  This map does not constitute official legal or technical advice.  It is recommended that conservation priority be given to sites with the highest PWDCA value in consultation with a wildlife biologist using contact information below.  Please also consider protection and management of entire watersheds, as impacts to headwaters areas have cumulative affects on downstream priority features such as rivers and wetlands.
    Supplemental_Information: Information on specific weights included in the model, and the process for determining weights will be included in the final report.  Contact DGIF for further information.
