      <p><b>The Colonial Period</b></p>

      <p>In Virginia, the process of creating new counties was
established in 1634, when the colonial legislature created the first eight
counties, or “shires” as they were called. These represent the first counties
created in the North American colonies. Settlement spread upstream along the
major river systems and into western areas of the colony, and the legislature
accommodated the pioneers by detaching the eastern, or "lower," parts
of the existing counties and creating new counties in the western remainder. As
exploration and settlement advanced, the Blue Ridge Mountains gradually became
the accepted western boundary of new counties. It was not until 1735, when
Orange County was created, that territory in present West Virginia was specifically
included in Virginia county creations. The eastern, northern, and southern
boundaries were typically defined in the session laws, but the western limits
were largely undefined. </p>

      <p>The initial legislation named the first eight shires
but did not provide any boundary descriptions (Hening, <i>Statutes at Large</i>,
1:224). This project used boundary descriptions found in Lyon Gardiner Tyler’s,
<i>Cradle of the Republic</i> (1906), the source also used by Charles Francis
Cocke for his three volumes on the parishes of Virginia. According to Tyler, Charles City County was
bounded by the Appomattox River, Henrico County extended indefinitely westward,
and no boundary description was provided for Charles River (now York) County.
Since the mapping program used by this project does not allow for open-ended
counties, the western limit of these early counties is based on the head of the
Appomattox River. This ensures that all areas of early European settlement are
included within these estimated boundaries (Tanner, <i>Settling of North
America</i>, 46).</p>

      <p>In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, Virginia relied
on its colonial charter of 1609 to claim vast areas of North America, including
all of the present states of Kentucky and West Virginia, part of Pennsylvania,
and everything east of the Mississippi River, north of the Ohio River, and
south of the Great Lakes. One way to exert jurisdiction over these areas was to
create counties, and this compilation includes all counties created by
Virginia, both within its modern boundaries, as well as those counties created
outside its current borders. For example, Kentucky was part of Virginia until
1792. In 1776, the Virginia legislature created Kentucky County, comprising all
of present Kentucky, and later carved nine of the state of Kentucky’s counties
from that original county. Virginia's creation in 1778 of the enormous Illinois
County encompassed all land claimed by Virginia north and west of the Ohio
River (all or part of six states); in 1784 Virginia ceded that territory to the
United States, which, in turn, created the Northwest Territory in 1787. The
overlapping of several Virginia counties (now in West Virginia) with western
Pennsylvania counties and the attempt by some North Carolinians in present
Tennessee to attach themselves to Virginia, reflect the reach of Virginia in
the colonial period. </p>

      <p>A pre-Revolutionary boundary line in what is now West
Virginia illustrates the challenges in mapping early counties. On January 31,
1770, Virginia created Botetourt County from Augusta County. The dividing line
ran easterly from the Blue Ridge Mountains to the head of “Carr’s Creek”
(Kerr’s Creek in modern Rockbridge County, Virginia), “thence north fifty-five
degrees west, as far as the courts of the two counties shall extend it” (Hening,
8:396). This fifty-five degree line extended over one hundred twenty-five miles
across all of modern West Virginia to the Ohio River and remained part of the
boundary of numerous counties until 1856 when Roane County was created. The
southern end of a line running at the prescribed angle through the source of
Kerr’s Creek matches up with the small (mile long) “notch” that still exists
between Webster and Pocahontas Counties, West Virginia, and the entire line
fits the requirements of several boundary descriptions prescribed for other
counties in the 1820s and 1830s. Sharp-eyed readers will notice that this line
lies about five miles north of the line Edgar Barr Sims plotted for this
boundary in the maps of historical West Virginia counties that he published in
the 1950s. The compilers nearly always have agreed with Sims’s versions of the
old boundaries, but in this case they believe the evidence favors the version
rendered here. </p>

      <p><b>Creating New Counties</b></p>

      <p>As in other states, creating and changing counties in
Virginia is the responsibility of the legislature. Until 1851 there were no
constitutional limits on county creations in Virginia. The state constitution
of 1851 required (1) that new counties contain at least 600 square miles; (2)
that the counties from which they were created not be reduced below 600 square
miles by such creations; (3) that no county with less than 5,000 white
residents could be deprived of more than one-fifth of its population; and (4)
that no county with more than 5,000 white residents could be reduced below
4,000. The constitution of 1864 continued these restrictions, whereas the
constitution of 1870 changed only the population requirements: no county with
less than 10,000 population could be deprived of more than one-fifth of its population,
and no county with more than 10,000 population could be reduced below 8,000.
The constitution of 1902 maintained the population stipulation that no county
could be reduced below 8,000 inhabitants. The 1971 state constitution has no
restrictions on county size or population. </p>

      <p>West Virginia broke away from Virginia in 1861, but was not
admitted to the Union as a separate state until 20 June1863. Most county
creations and changes in present West Virginia occurred prior to 1863 under the
authority of the Virginia legislature. The basic process of creating new
counties that was established by Virginia was continued by West Virginia. The
West Virginia state constitution of 1861 required that each new county, and the
counties from which it was taken, have at least 400 square miles and 4,000
white residents; the current constitution (1872) raised the resident
requirement to 6,000, and stipulated further that no new county could be formed
without the consent of a majority of the voters residing within the boundaries
of the proposed new county. These constitutional provisions complicated the
process of creating new counties. For example, the boundaries of Lincoln County
(created in 1867, from four counties) were altered, redefined, and clarified
six times before 1955, when the legislature again "defined and
established" Lincoln's boundaries. </p>

      <p>The many legal boundary adjustments, clarifications, and
redefinitions in both Virginia and West Virginia reflect the rapidly expanding
population and often inadequate geographical knowledge that lay behind those
changes. The laws frequently defined boundaries that ran along mountain ridges,
between river systems, and to the "heads" of rivers or
streams—directions too often vague and imprecise. Also, county boundaries often
involved landmarks that cannot be identified today, e.g., the property of named
individuals, roads, water fords, ferries, mills, and river landings. Finally,
some boundaries were ephemeral, disappearing completely in later boundary
changes and sometimes in existence for only a brief time. Judging by the many
boundary disputes and the stated reasons for specific boundary changes, it also
is apparent that many county boundaries were not surveyed or clearly marked.
For these reasons, some historical county boundaries are unavoidably
conjectural. Such lines are considered to be “estimated lines,” and are noted
as such in the attribute table, but cannot be so marked on the <i>Interactive
Map</i>.</p>

      <p><b>Independent Cities in Virginia</b></p>

      <p>The 1902 state constitution authorized the establishment of
independent cities, a phenomenon found only in Virginia, Maryland, Missouri,
and Nevada. Virginia created a total of forty-five independent cities, some of
which have become extinct or reverted to town status. Initially, cities were
divided into two classes: first-class cities (more than 10,000 population) were
completely autonomous and operated in all respects like counties; second-class
cities (5,000–10,000 population) had all the powers of first-class cities,
except that they did not have a court system separate from the county in which
they were located. Since 1902, most territorial changes between independent
cities and counties have been gains by the cities from the counties. Conflict
has developed between cities, which generally wished to expand, and counties,
which wanted to protect and maintain their territory. Since the 1980s,
additions to the Virginia Code have made it more difficult for independent
cities to engage in hostile annexations of county territory, and the number of
boundary changes had slowed, but not completely stopped, by 2000.</p>

      <p>Mapping the independent cities creates special problems
because the annexation process by which these cities expand principally is
based on judicial rather than legislative proceedings, and the amount of land
involved is often very small. There appears to be no single, comprehensive
repository that recorded all independent city annexations, and the Atlas of Historical
County Boundaries Project has gathered information from various sources. For
annexations from 1902 to the mid-1960s, the compilers relied on Chester W.
Bain’s, <i>Annexation in Virginia</i> (1966). Additional information was
acquired from the U.S. Census Bureau, Virginia county and city officials, and
from the Virginia Commission on Local Government, which is charged with
developing “advisory reports on local boundary change and governmental
transition issues for localities and the courts.” Despite these efforts, the
compilers suspect there may be some omissions.</p>

       <p><b>Sources</b></p>

      <p>From the early years of Virginia’s existence, virtually all
boundary changes were made by the legislature. The laws for the period 1619
(the meeting of the first legislature) through 1792 were collected by William
W. Hening and published in thirteen volumes of <i>Statutes at Large; Being a
Collection of All the Laws of Virginia, from the First Session of the
Legislature in the Year 1619 [to 1792]</i>. Published in Richmond, 1819–1823,
they have become a classic and a standard. Hening's pioneering work was
continued by Samuel Shepherd, who carried the series through the 1807–1808
session. Some additional laws, not in Hening (or in Hening by title only), are
printed in Morgan P. Robinson, <i>Virginia Counties: Those Resulting from
Virginia's Legislation</i> (1916), and Waverly K. Winfree, ed., <i>Laws of
Virginia: Being a Supplement to Hening's Statutes at Large, 1700–1750</i>
(1971). Hening does not include the dates of passage for laws approved before
1787; in this compilation those dates are taken from Robinson’s, <i>Virginia
Counties</i>. Early laws related to counties now in Kentucky and West Virginia,
but created by Virginia, are also included in Hening.</p>

      <p>A number of secondary works were valuable in the compilation
of Virginia and West Virginia county boundaries. Michael F. Doran, <i>Atlas of
County Boundary Changes in Virginia, 1634–1895</i> (1987), has maps, by decade;
while Edgar B. Sims, <i>Map of Present State of West Virginia</i> (1954), has
nine maps showing county boundary changes by decade, from 1769 to the present.
Sims's <i>Making a State</i> (1956) has a valuable index and summary of county
boundary changes in West Virginia, supplemented by ten maps (essentially the
same maps as in his <i>Map of Present State</i>...). For background on the
Virginia independent cities, see Chester W. Bain, <i>Annexation in Virginia:
The Use of the Judicial Process for Readjusting City-County Boundaries</i>
(1966), and Bain, <i>"A Body Incorporate": The Evolution of
City-State Separation in Virginia</i> (1967). For parish boundaries, Charles
Francis Cocke's three volumes are invaluable: <i>Parish Lines: Diocese of
Southwestern Virginia</i> (1960); <i>Parish Lines: Diocese of Southern Virginia</i>
(1964); and <i>Parish Lines: Diocese of Virginia</i> (1967).</p>

      <p>Historical maps do not frequently play a large role in this
sort of work. Occasionally they are indispensable for lost landmarks and names
no longer in use, but seldom for interpretations of boundary descriptions. A
useful modern source was the large-scale, up-to-date county map collection
published by the Virginia Department of Transportation, <i>County Road Map
Atlas</i> (1987). These maps are reliable compilations of the details of
boundaries, roads, natural features, and other landmarks.</p>

      <p><b>Dates</b></p>

      <p>Every effort has been made to give the day, month, and year
(e.g., 25 February 1785) for all county creations, boundary changes, and other
events. Occasionally it is impossible to date an event so precisely, but a
reasonable estimate is possible. When the precise date is not known or an approximate
date is more appropriate, the date is generalized to the month and year (e.g.,
February 1785) or to the year alone. A lack of evidence may make it impossible
to give any date at all for a county's creation, and its occurrence can only be
confirmed by the record of a later, related happening, such as the appointment
of a sheriff. In such a situation, the date of the later event is used with the
simple addition of "by" (e.g., by 25 February 1785) to indicate that
the county creation or other event occurred no later than that date and
probably earlier. The dating standard used is the legally effective date of
change, whether it be for the creation of a new county or for the alteration of
lines between existing counties.</p>

      <p>Dating events before 1752 is a problem because the calendar
then in use is very different from the one in use today. Whereas by 1600 most
of Europe had adopted the Gregorian calendar, as the modern system of reckoning
the days is called, England observed the Julian calendar until 2 September
1752. Under the old Julian calendar the last day of the year was 24 March and
the first day was 25 March, which means that in England and its colonies,
including Virginia, the day after 24 March 1750 was 25 March 1751. In its
databases this project uses the modern, Gregorian year for dates that fall
within the period from 1 January through 24 March, because software cannot
handle dual-year dates. But dual dates are cited in the text portion of an
entry, since original documents may record the date according to the Julian
calendar. Thus the date, 1 January 1735, may appear in the “Date” column of the
attribute table and database, but the descriptive entry for that date would
show the date as 1 January 1734/1735, indicating that people of the time still considered
this date to be in the year 1734.</p>
