<span class='change'>King James I chartered
two Virginia Companies, headquartered in different cities, to establish
colonies along the coast of North America. The Virginia Company of London was
assigned coast between 34 degrees and 41 degrees north latitude, including
present Virginia, and the Virginia Company of Plymouth was assigned coast between
38 degrees and 45 degrees north latitude. Colonies of the two companies were to
be at least 100 miles apart, even where grants overlapped. First permanent
settlement in Virginia was established at Jamestown in 1607.</span>

30 minutes north latitude. The new northern line implicitly redefined the
southern limit of Virginia as the parallel of 36 degrees, 30 minutes north

<span class='change'>Virginia created West Augusta District (extinct) from AUGUSTA
to provide jurisdiction over the Pittsburgh region in present Pennsylvania.
Boundaries were not specified at the time (described in detail in 1776 when the
District was replaced by three new counties) but were obviously meant to cover
area around the head of the Ohio River that Virginia claimed was within its
1609 charter limits and west of Pennsylvania's western limit. This extension of
Virginia's jurisdiction conflicted with Pennsylvania, which in February 1773
had created WESTMORELAND County for the region. At this time, Pennsylvania had
actual control of the territory.</span>
