    Abstract:
      This data set is a raster file of z values with 3162 columns and 3163 rows. The data set was extracted from a larger classified data set and only includes points classified as Ground, Model Key-point (mass point), and Bathymetric Lidar Points within the requested geographic bounds.

      TASK ORDER NAME: VIRGINIA AND MARYLAND LIDAR ACQUISITION FOR HURRICANE SANDY RESPONSE
      CONTRACT NUMBER: W912P9-10-D-0533
      TASK ORDER NUMBER: W81C8X2314841
      Woolpert Project Number: 72903

      HQUSACE required high-resolution digital elevation data developed from airborne LiDAR technology for the Assateague Island, MD;  Assateague Island, VA; Tangier Island, VA; Cape Henry to Willoughby Point, VA; AOIs for a total of
      approximately eighty (80) square miles in the North Atlantic Division.

      FINAL DELIVERABLES:
      The final deliverables are listed below. The final LiDAR data was delivered in a UTM projection tiling format, based on a modular layout. The tiles were clipped to eliminate overlap between adjacent tiles.
      The 1000 meter x 1000 meter tile file name was derived from the National Grid naming convention.
    Purpose:
      The data will be used by the USACE to generate digital elevation models and contours for use in, damage assessment to USACE projects, engineering design and design reviews, conservation planning, research, delivery,
      floodplain mapping, and hydrologic modeling utilizing LiDAR technology. The task order required that the LiDAR data was to be acquired within six (6) days of receiving Notice to Proceed (NTP). The project data will
      consist of high accuracy classified bare-earth LiDAR data in LAS format well as raster digital elevation models per task order requirements. The specifications are based upon the U.S. Geological Survey National Geospatial
      Program Lidar Base Specifications 1.0, which may be viewed at http://pub.usgs.gov/tm/11b4/.

      Process_Description:
        Using an Optech Gemini LiDAR Sensor, 32 flight lines of high density data, at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 1 meter, were collected along the Virginia coastal area separated into areas of interest: Assateague Island (Maryland),
        Assateague Island (Virginia), Tangier Island (Virginia), and Cape Henry to Willoughby Point (Virginia) (approximately  80 square miles). Data Acquisition Height = 5,500 feet AGL - Aircraft Speed = 125 Knots. Multiple returns were
        recorded for each laser pulse along with an intensity value for each return. A total of three (3) missions were flown during a period from November 9, 2012 through November 11, 2012. Two airborne global positioning system (GPS)
        base stations were used in support of the LiDAR data acquisition. Sixteen (16) ground control points were surveyed through static methods. The geoid used to reduce satellite derived elevations to orthometric heights was Geoid12A.
        Data for the task order is referenced to the UTM Zone 18N, North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83), and NAVD88, in Meters. Airborne GPS data was differentially processed and integrated with the post processed IMU data to derive a
        smoothed best estimate of trajectory (SBET). The SBET was used to reduce the LiDAR slant range measurements to a raw reflective surface for each flight line. The coverage was classified to extract a bare earth digital elevation
        model (DEM) and separate last returns. In addition to the LAS deliverables, one layer of coverage was delivered in the ArcGrid Format: bare-earth.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        The LiDAR system calibration and system performance is verified on a periodic basis using Woolpert's calibration range. The calibration range consists of a large building and runway. The edges of the building and control points
        along the runway have been located using conventional survey methods. Inertial measurement unit (IMU) misalignment angles and horizontal accuracy are calculated by comparing the position of the building edges between opposing
        flight lines. The scanner scale factor and vertical accuracy is calculated through comparison of LiDAR data against control points along the runway. Field calibration is performed on all flight lines to refine the IMU
        misalignment angles. IMU misalignment angles are calculated from the relative displacement of features within the overlap region of adjacent (and opposing) flight lines. The raw LiDAR data is reduced using the refined
        misalignment angles.

      Process_Description:
        Once the data acquisition and GPS processing phases are complete, the LiDAR data was processed immediately to verify the coverage had no voids. The GPS and IMU data was post processed using differential and Kalman filter
        algorithms to derive a best estimate of trajectory. The quality of the solution was verified to be consistent with the accuracy requirements of the project.

      Process_Description:
        The individual flight lines were inspected to ensure the systematic and residual errors have been identified and removed. Then, the flight lines were compared to adjacent flight lines for any mismatches to obtain a homogenous
        coverage throughout the project area. The point cloud underwent a classification process to determine bare-earth points and non-ground points utilizing "first and only" as well as "last of many" LiDAR returns. This process
        determined Default (Class 1), Ground (Class 2),Noise (Class 7), Model Key Points (Class 8), and Overlap (Class 12) classifications. The bare-earth (Class 2 - Ground) LiDAR points underwent a manual QA/QC step to verify that
        artifacts have been removed from the bare-earth surface. The surveyed ground control points are used to perform the accuracy checks and statistical analysis of the LiDAR dataset.

      Process_Description:
        The NOAA Coastal Services Center (CSC) received topographic files in LAS format. The files contained lidar
        elevation and intensity measurements. The data were received in projected coordinates of NAD83 UTM18N, meters
        and were vertically referenced to NAVD88 using the Geoid12a model. The vertical units of the data were
        meters. CSC performed the following processing for data storage and Digital Coast provisioning purposes:
        1. The topographic las files were converted from orthometric (NAVD88) heights to ellipsoidal heights using Geoid12a.
        2. The topographic las files were converted from Projected Coordinates (NAD83 UTM18N, meters) to Geographic Coordinates (NAD83, decimal degrees).

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        The cell values in this data set represent the average elevation measurement found within each cell, or if there were no values in the cell, a value may have been interpolated from surrounding cells with data values.  The perimeter cells of a 3x3 box surrounding the empty cell is queried for known values - if less than three values are found, then the perimeter cells of a 5x5 box is searched for known values.  This process is repeated for a 7x7 box if less than 3 values are found.  If less than three accumulated known values were found, then the cell is assigned a no data value (usually -999999). If at least 3 values were found in that search, the value in the empty cell is interpolated from the known values using an Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) method.
