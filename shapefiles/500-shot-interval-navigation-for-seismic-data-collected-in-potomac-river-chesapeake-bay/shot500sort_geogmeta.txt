  Description:
    Abstract: In order to test hypotheses about groundwater flow under and into Chesapeake Bay, geophysical surveys were conducted by U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) scientists on Chesapeake Bay and the Potomac River Estuary in September 2006. Chesapeake Bay resource managers are concerned about nutrients that are entering the estuary via submarine groundwater discharge, which are contributing to eutrophication. The USGS has performed many related studies in recent years to provide managers with information necessary to make informed decisions about this issue. The research carried out as part of the study described here was designed to help refine nutrient budgets for Chesapeake Bay by characterizing submarine groundwater flow and discharge of groundwater beneath part of the mainstem and a major tributary, the Potomac River Estuary.
    Purpose: The purpose of this layer is to provide all of the 500 shot point navigation associated with the seismic-reflection profiles collected on USGS cruise 06018. This information can help spatially correlate the seismic-reflection profiles with other features and data in the GIS.

Data_Quality_Information:
  Logical_Consistency_Report: These points were visually checked to make sure they were viable fixes.
  Completeness_Report: This shapefile represents the 500 shot interval navigation for all the seismic lines collected on this cruise.
  Positional_Accuracy:
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report: A differential global positioning system (DGPS) was used for the seismic-reflection data. This system was an Ashtech DGPS2 with the navigation being recorded by HYPACK navigation software. The offset from the seismic transducer to the DGPS antenna was 2 meters. This offset was not entered into the software.
    Vertical_Positional_Accuracy:
      Vertical_Positional_Accuracy_Report: Although bathymetry was not recorded directly, bathymetry can be derived by tracing the seafloor reflector in the seismic-reflection profiles. The seismic transducers were mounted on an over the side mount on the port side of the ship. The transducer draft was 0.7 m below the water surface. The draft offset was not included in the data acquisition.
  Lineage:
    Source_Information:
      Source_Contribution: The seismic acquisition system used on this cruise was a Knudsen Engineering Limited (KEL)1600 USB system. The system has up to 1.2 kW power and is tuned to work with two Massa 3.5 kHz transducers. The transducers were mounted on an over-the-side mount on the port side of the ship. The transducer draft was 0.7 m below the water surface. This draft offset was not included in the data acquisition. The seismic data acquisition software was SounderSuite-USB Beta. This system failed to acquire navigation data from the DGPS NEMA string on the first two days (Julian day 149 and 150). The software was also not able to record data in SEG-Y standard format. KEL KEB format files were logged to disk. In addition, KEA ASCII files with shot (ping) numbers and times were saved to disk. Shot point navigation was also absent in the KEA files on Julian days 149 and 150. On Julian day 151 a patched version of SounderSuite was received and installed. This version recorded navigation in the KEB and KEA files. SEG-Y recording was still not an option. A time server was used to synchronize the DGPS time on the KEL and HYPACK navigation systems. This was important as KEL SounderSuite records system time. Data were acquired at a 20 micro-second sample interval, 2048 samples for a 40 ms record length. Fire-rate was 0.20 seconds (or 5 shots per second). The KEL SounderSuite software was set up to automatically switch files at shot 20,000. Line 5 switched from file 0005_2006_249_2014_002.keb after shot 13509 to a new file (0005_2006_249_2014_003.keb) while changing display parameters, due to a bug in the acquisition software.
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: An ArcView 3.3 avenue script written in Woods Hole (point2line.ave) was used to connect the individual shot points using the attribute "linename" as the unique line identifier. That attribute is also brought over to the resulting polyline shapefile. This process step, as well as all subsequent process steps, were performed by the same person - VeeAnn A. Cross.

Create a hatch interval of 500 for the Hatch Class, then for Hatch Def(1) place a marker hatch every 1 hatch interval. From the Hatch Class Add a Hatch Definition - Add End Hatch Definition and set these to a marker Hatch. By displaying the labels for both Hatch Definitions, a quick comparison between the hatches and shot navigation makes sure things are behaving as intended. Then turn the labels off.

      Source_Produced_Citation_Abbreviation: shot500sort.shp
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: There are lines that show no break between files because the Knudsen was set to record data and automatically switch files every 20,000 shots. This made the last shot of one file the same as the first shot of the subsequent file. This leads to duplicate shot #1 at these bounds during linear referencing. The first shot #1 should really be shot 19999 of the previous file. To account for this, the attributes of the shapefile were edit to reflect this (effectively removing the duplicate shots). So for instance, two records have the linename 0001_2006_249_1447_002 and shot 1. The first record was changed to linename 001_2006_249_1340_001 with shot number 19999. This way, every shot has a unique line number - shot combination.
