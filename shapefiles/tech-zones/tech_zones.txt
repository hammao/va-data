  Description:
    Abstract:
      Virginia cities, counties and towns have the ability to establish, by ordinance, one or more technology zones to attract growth in targeted industries. Qualified businesses locating or expanding operations in a zone may receive local
      permit and user fee waivers, local tax incentives, special zoning treatment or exemption from ordinances. Once a local technology zone has been established, incentives may be provided for up to ten years. Each locality designs and administers its own program.
      As of May 2009, localities that have established technology zones include Arlington, Culpepper, Frederick, Halifax, Henry, Roanoke, Rockingham, Russell, Spotsylvania, Smyth and Warren Counties, the cities of Bedford, Charlottesville, Falls Church, Franklin, Harrisonburg, Lynchburg, Roanoke, and Winchester, and the towns of Front Royal in Warren County, and Marion in Smyth County.
    Purpose: The purpose of the state technology zones dataset is to illustrate the economic incentive provided by these regions to businesses contemplating expanding or relocating to Virginia.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: Michelle Mende in VEDP's Research Division contacted all of the localities and collected information on the status of local technology zones.  The localities with technology zones were instructed to either send mapping or GIS shapefiles of their technology zones to assist in the update of this dataset.  Hard copy maps were digitized using ESRI ArcGIS (ArcInfo 9.3) with VBMP and county parcel data (when available) as a basemap.  Shapefiles were incorporated into the overall technology zones shapefile.
