      Source_Contribution: Previous versions of this dataset were compared to a Virginia Department of Correction facilities dataset prepared by the Virginia Geographic Information Network for the VDOC.  Corrections were made as needed.
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: The site location of each adult and juvenile correctional facility was orginally digitized using SPOT 2000, USGS Digital Orthophotos and USGS Digital Raster Graphics.  Updates to the dataset were digitized using 2002 VBMP Orthophotography.  The digitized point was chosen based upon the approximate location of the front door of the main facility on the property.  The projection of the digitized data set is in Lambert Conformal Conic, allowing use of this information with other VEDP coverages.  All of the digitizing was done utilizing ArcView.
