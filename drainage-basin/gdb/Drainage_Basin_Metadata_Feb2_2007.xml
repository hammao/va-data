			<abstract>The Drainage_Basin polygon feature class was created as a digital representation of drainage basins for  more than 1,650 continuous-record streamflow-gaging stations, partial record streamflow-gaging stations of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), and other watercourse locations of interest.  The Drainage_Basin polygon feature class replaces the drainage basins previously derived through planimetric methods on paper maps, and provides a digital representation that previously was unavailable.  The dataset will be used for the update and publication of drainage areas to all USGS stations in Virginia.  This dataset represents historical flow patterns and avoids anthropogenic changes to flow when possible.

The Drainage_Basin polygon feature class has a unique format with cascading, or stacked, polygons.  In a coverage format, to calculate the drainage area of a large basin containing multiple sub-basins, the area from multiple polygons would be summed.  However, within the Drainage_Basin polygon feature class, one polygon is used to store the entire drainage area to each USGS station.  Because geodatabases and shapefiles are able to store multiple copies of the same geometry, the Drainage_Basin polygon feature class can hold polygons that are stacked.  During the digitizing and editing phases topology rules were utilized to ensure that stacked linework was identical.

Each polygon in Drainage_Basin has a value within the Station_number field.  Most values represent USGS station number found in the National Water Information System (NWIS) database http://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis.  The station locations stored within NWIS represent the locations of monitoring equipment maintained by the USGS.  During the delineation process, these locations were used as reference points to the downstream end of a drainage basin, but usually were not the outlet point.  For this reason, the point locations are not contained in this dataset.  Most are available through NWIS by searching for the station number.</abstract>
			<purpose>Digital dataset to represent official drainage basins for continuous-record streamflow-gaging stations, partial record streamflow-gaging stations of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), and other watercourse locations of interest.  The dataset will be used for the update and publication of drainage areas to all USGS stations in Virginia.</purpose>

		<logic>The source of these data was a coverage (WBD) that was built and cleaned.  The cluster tolerance used was 1.2 meters and the snapping tolerance was 6 meters.  As the Drainage_Basin dataset was constructed, tolopogy rules were used in a personal geodatabase to maintain topological integrity.  Feature classes involved in the topology included: Temporary line feature class, DrainageDivide line feature class, and Drainage_Basin polygon feature class.  Topology rules used are listed below:

&gt;Temporary lines   Must not Have Dangles
&gt;Temporary lines   Must Not Intersect or Touch Interior
&gt;DrainageDivide   Must not Have Dangles
&gt;DrainageDivide   Must Not Intersect or Touch Interior
&gt;DrainageDivide   Must be Covered by the Boundary of Drainage_Basin
&gt;Drainage_Basin    Must be Covered by the Boundary of DrainageDivide
&gt;Temporary lines   Must be Covered by the Feature Class of DrainageDivide
&gt;DrainageDivide   Must not have Pseudos
&gt;DrainageDivide   Must be Single Part</logic>
		<complete>At the time of publication all active and discontinued continuous-record streamflow-gaging station drainage basins and many partial record streamflow-gaging station drainage basins were included in this dataset.  Additional drainage basins are included for watercourse locations of interest.</complete>

				<horizpar>WBD lines were originally digitized using contours on USGS 1:24,0000 quadrangles as a base. The resulting accuracy of the linework should be consistent with hand-drawn basins on paper maps that were subsequently digitized on-screen. Typically accuracy is set at 1/2 the contour interval.  In Virginia the largest contour interval is 40 feet.  Half of this interval is 20 feet, or 6 meters.</horizpar>

						<othercit>These are the new national fifth and sixth order hydrologic units for Virginia.  They have been created in compliance with the new Federal
Standards for Delineation of Hydrologic Unit Boundaries (1 October 2004) and therefore differ from the existing sixth order (14 digit) hydrologic units of Virginia as developed by DCR and the USDA in 1995 from the previous
standards. This dataset covers the whole state and is seamless with surrounding state's NWBD product.  Revised first through fifth order units are obtainable from codes in this layer.

The Virginia WBD was developed as part of a seamless hydrologic unit product for the nation, to be used for more detailed watershed planning work in the state than can be performed using lower order units.
This becomes the official statewide sixth order hydrologic unit delineation for Virginia.

								<othercit>The Watershed Boundary Dataset is being developed under the leadership of the Subcommittee on Spatial Water Data, which is part of the Advisory Committee on Water Information (ACWI) and the Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC). The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), along with many other federal agencies and national associations, have representatives on the Subcommittee on Spatial Water Data.

As watershed boundary geographic information systems (GIS) coverages are completed, statewide and national data layers will be made available via the Geospatial Data Gateway to everyone, including federal, state, local government agencies, researchers, private companies, utilities, environmental groups, and concerned citizens. The database will assist in planning and describing water use and related land use activities.</othercit>

				<procdesc>Basemap datasets were derived from the Virginia Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD), USGS digital quadrangles (DRG), the National Water Information System (NWIS) site information, the National Elevation Dataset (NED), and the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Reach File version 3.0 (RF3).  The Virginia WBD (updated in 2005) served as the primary source of linework for this dataset.  The contours within the USGS digital quadrangles were relied upon for basin delineation and checking the WBD linework.  NED was used to delineate basins above selected point locations from NWIS. The NED-delineated basins and RF3 streams were used as additional guides for on-screen digitizing and selection of WBD lines for inclusion in the Drainage_Divide line feature class and Drainage_Basin polygon feature class.</procdesc>

				<procdesc>To construct one stacked polygon the following procedure was completed.  Lines were selected from the WBD and Drainage_Divide line feature class then copied into a temporary line feature class.  The lines from the WBD were checked for accuracy against the contours in the DRG's and modified when necessary.  The WBD was modified to include tributaries or areas that had inadverdantly been excluded, or when the DRG contour lines indicated a peak or ridge line that had not been followed.  When one entire drainage basin was represented in the temporary feature class topology was validated, errors corrected, and validated again.  These lines were copied into a permanent line feature class, Drainage_Divide.  Drainage_Divide is not stacked and stores the outlines of all basins one time only.</procdesc>

				<procdesc>Lines stored in Drainage_Divide match all existing linework in the Drainage_Basin except for new linework for a polygon.  Topology rules indicate a difference in linework when the only error that remains is 'Drainage_Divide  Must be Covered by the Boundary of Drainage_Basin'.  Polygons are constructed by selecting lines from the temporary feature class and choosing the 'construct features' option from the topology toolbar.  This process creates one new polygon in the Drainage_Basin polygon feature class.

This process was repeated for each basin, with lines copied from Drainage_Divide, the WBD, and with on-screen digitizing.  For every polygon that was created, the boundary was constructed in the temporary line feature class, new lines copied into Drainage_Divide, topology rules run, errors corrected, and new polygon constructed.</procdesc>

		<overview>
			<eaover>The attributes incuded in this dataset help to group the drainage basins into larger watersheds and regional drainage patterns.  The station identification field links each drainage basin to one USGS stream-flow gaging station, partial-record site, or watercourse location of interest.  The drainage area in square miles should serve as the official drainage area for the given USGS station.</eaover>
			<eadetcit>Most of the information herein is derived from USGS datasets and digital databases.</eadetcit>
