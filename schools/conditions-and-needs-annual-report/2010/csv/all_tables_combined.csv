Dear Governor McDonnell and Members of the Virginia General Assembly:
"On behalf of the Board of Education, I am pleased to transmit the 2010 Annual Report on the"
"Condition and Needs of Public Schools in Virginia, submitted pursuant to § 22.1-18 of the Code of"
"Virginia. The report contains information on Virginia’s public schools, including an analysis"
of student academic performance and a report on the school divisions’ compliance with the
requirements of the Standards of Quality and the Standards of Accreditation.
Increasing academic achievement for all students is the core of the Board of Education’s
mission. This means that every student is expected to graduate from high school prepared
to move on to productive work and further study. This report contains compelling evidence
that our schools and our students are achieving at higher levels. The progress shown by our
"public schools is the result of ongoing collaboration, dedication, workable strategies, and"
"wise use of resources, both human and financial. It is the result of the hard work of"
"students, teachers, administrators, support staff, parents, and supporters throughout the"
Commonwealth.
"The report also points to evidence that persistent challenges remain to be tackled, and there"
is a challenging year ahead as the state and localities face the economic headwinds that have
developed in recent months.
The Board of Education is grateful for the continued support that the Governor and
"General Assembly give to Virginia’s school improvement efforts. As we look to the future,"
the members of the Board of Education pledge to remain focused on providing the best
educational opportunities and the brightest future for the young people enrolled in Virginia’s
public schools.
"Sincerely,"
Eleanor B. Saslaw
President

Important National Comparisons: Virginia Students Increase Achievement in
"Critical Reading, Mathematics, and Writing"
Results from national reading tests show that Virginia elementary and middle school
students continue to outperform their peers nationwide and are among the nation’s strongest
readers. The average reading scores of Virginia students on the 2009 National Assessment of
"Education Progress (NAEP) – also known as ""The Nation’s Report Card"" – were"
significantly higher than the average scores of their national and regional peers.
"While Virginia students again ranked among the nation’s highest achievers, the 2009 NAEP"
results show that overall achievement among Virginia fourth graders is similar to
"achievement in 2002, while the overall average reading score for eighth graders has declined."
Virginia Students Outperform Peers Nationwide on SAT
Virginia’s 2010 public school graduates increased their achievement and outperformed their
"peers nationwide on all three sections of the SAT college-admissions test, according to the"
"College Board. In the last ten years, average scores of Virginia public school students on the"
SAT have increased by five points in reading and 15 points in mathematics. This compares
with a national decline of four points in reading and a gain of one point in mathematics.
Black and Hispanic Virginia public school graduates increased their achievement and
outperformed their peers nationwide on all three SAT subsections.
Virginia Ranks Among the Top on Advanced Placement Results
The College Board’s February 2010 Advanced Placement Report to the Nation ranked
Virginia third in the nation in achievement on AP examinations. This compares with a
national decline of four points in reading and a gain of one point in mathematics. Moreover
"since 2006, the number of black public school students in Virginia participating in AP testing"
"has increased by 74.4 percent, and the number of Hispanic students taking AP tests has"
increased by 70.2 percent.
Virginia Students Score Higher than Peers on ACT
Virginia public high school graduates achieved significantly higher scores on the ACT this
"year, and the number of public school seniors taking the college-admissions examination"
continued to grow. Public school students in Virginia improved in all subjects. The
percentage of Virginia public school students meeting ACT college-readiness benchmarks
was seven or more points higher than the percentage nationwide.
Six out of 10 Virginia Schools Exceed NCLB Objectives
Six out of 10 Virginia schools exceeded or met all No Child Left Behind (NCLB) objectives
during 2009-2010 despite new accountability provisions related to high school graduation
and the testing of students with disabilities.
Sixty percent of Virginia’s public schools made “adequate yearly progress” (AYP) by
surpassing objectives in reading and mathematics and meeting other indicators of academic
"progress, compared with 71 percent last year."

Ensuring Virginia’s Academic Standards Lead the Nation in Rigor and Quality
The Board of Education has taken an aggressive stand to ensure that the Standards of
Learning program is tightly aligned with the national expectations for student achievement.
"In 2010, the National Governors Association (NGA) and the Council of Chief State School"
Officers (CCSSO) released the Mathematics Common Core State Standards. Virginia’s 2009
Mathematics Standards of Learning and Mathematics Curriculum Framework have a strong
"alignment to the Mathematics Common Core State Standards. In fact, the Board took action"
in November 2010 and adopted supplement to the curriculum framework for the Mathematics
Standards of Learning. The supplement completes and strengthens the content to equal or
exceed the content and rigor of the Mathematics Common Core State Standards.
"In addition to the intense focus on the mathematics standards, the Board revised the"
Curriculum Framework for the English Standards of Learning. The revised framework contains
"content that was recommended by Achieve, The College Board, and ACT as a result of"
comparison studies of Virginia’s standards with their respective standards and benchmarks
"for postsecondary readiness. Additionally, the revised curriculum framework contains"
"content from the English/Language Arts Common Core State Standards. Thus, Virginia’s"
standards meet or exceed national standards in English as well as in mathematics.
Funding the Standards of Quality (SOQ)
There can be no doubt that a challenging year is ahead as Virginia’s public schools face the
economic headwinds that have developed in recent months. The difficult fiscal situation will
"be exacerbated if the flow of federal stimulus funds ends, as expected. In Virginia, Direct"
Aid to localities for public education is the single largest General Fund expenditure. The
current fiscal climate at the state and federal levels challenges the stability of public
"education, social services, and other supports for children and families. Resources are"
limited for students who require extra help or special attention. The challenge requires that
fiscal and human resources be focused on the instruction students receive in the classroom
and on making sure every student is successful.
Assisting Chronically Low-Performing Schools
What to do about chronically low-performing schools is a central issue in the Board of
Education’s school improvement efforts and accountability system. Its urgency is
"underscored by the federal Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), which"
mandates an aggressive system of corrective measures for schools receiving federal
assistance that fail to meet progress goals.
It is anticipated that more schools will struggle to meet full accreditation because of difficulty
in meeting the aggressive objective for graduation rates and other key measures set by the
"Board of Education. As the Board moves to increase the rigor for full accreditation,"
continuing the technical assistance and interventions by the Virginia Department of
2010 Annual Report on Condition and Needs of Public Schools
Page 15
Education to assist divisions previously identified as low-performing may become
"increasingly difficult, especially in this time of agency budget and staffing restrictions."
Providing Programs to Narrow Persistent Achievement Gaps
This is one of the most pressing challenges that states across this nation face. Virginia is no
exception. Gaps in graduation rates exist between Virginia’s black and Hispanic students and
their white and Asian counterparts. This is equally true for students who are economically
"disadvantaged. Although improving, gaps also persist on the statewide assessments among"
Virginia’s black and Hispanic students and their white and Asian counterparts. Recent
"changes in federal education policy have put the spotlight on the achievement gap issue, and"
schools are struggling to bring all students’ achievement up to high levels.
"The good news is Virginia is making progress. For example, Virginia has one of the nation's"
"smallest achievement gaps between whites and Hispanics. Here, eighth-grade Hispanic"
students had the highest NAEP writing scores for Hispanic students in any state. The
persistent challenge is to accelerate this progress and raise the achievement of all students.
Implementing New Learning Opportunities for Students
The Board of Education is putting in place new policies and guidelines for initiatives that
expand learning opportunities for all children. These policies relate to high-quality charter
"schools, college partnership laboratory schools, and online learning programs. This also"
"includes science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education programs."
The Board’s challenge is to ensure that its policies and the manner in which they are
"implemented are student-centered, effective, cost-efficient, and practical."
Dealing with Increasingly Burdensome Federal Reporting Requirements
At a time in which the Virginia Department of Education is actively seeking ways to cut
"reporting requirements on local divisions, the department must itself keep up with"
increasingly burdensome and time-consuming federal reporting and accountability
"requirements, especially those related to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act"
"(previously known as No Child Left Behind), the Individuals with Disabilities Education"
"Act, and the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund."
Promoting High-Quality Preschool Programs
The number of school divisions participating in the Virginia Preschool Initiative has grown
"from 75 in the 2001-2002 school year, to 114 in the 2008-2009 school year. Also, the"
"number of children served has grown from 5,966 in 2001-2002 to 15,900 children in 2010."
"Despite this growth, the number of at-risk four-year-olds in Virginia continues to be a"
"concern. Without providing high quality preschool to all at-risk four-year-olds, many at-risk"
five-year-old children will continue to enter kindergarten without adequate preparation to be
fully ready to learn.

"way to or from school, and involved in school-sponsored activities. The Board must"
"continue to stress the importance of successful, communitywide partnerships in the"
"development of procedures and policies that most effectively support healthy, safe, orderly"
and disciplined school environments.
"Preparation, Recruitment, and Retention of Educational Personnel"
The current economic down-turn for the state and the localities will impact teacher
"recruitment and retention. Due to budget limitations, many localities are proceeding with"
"slimmed-down teacher recruitment and hiring. For some divisions, teacher and staff layoffs"
"may be unavoidable. At least in part a result of economic hard times, hiring new teachers"
will likely decrease because current classroom teachers will stay put by holding on to their
"jobs or by deferring retirement. Thus, for the next several years the reality for teacher supply"
and demand is two-fold: available teaching positions will become scarce except for some
"chronic shortage areas, and divisions will struggle to close looming budget gaps, making"
teacher and staff layoffs unavoidable for some.
"Digging deeper for the long term, additional underlying demographics will impact teacher"
recruitment and retention. Finding and retaining qualified teachers in chronic shortage areas
have been persistent problems for many local divisions. Shortage areas include special
"education, mathematics, some foreign languages, and teachers of English as a Second"
"Language. Moreover, approximately one-fifth of our teaching force and one-fourth of the"
principals and assistant principals are aged 55 or older —a significant number of teachers
and principals now at or nearing full retirement age. Antidotal evidence shows a higher-
"than-normal turnover rate for division superintendents, as well. When considered as a"
"whole, these demographics mean challenging times ahead, both short-term and long-term."
Recruiting Minority Teachers
Boosting the diversity of Virginia's teaching staff is crucial at a time when educators are
worrying about eliminating achievement gaps. The gap between the diversity of students in
the schools and the ethnic characteristics of the teaching force poses a key question: will
teachers reflect the tremendous diversity of the students they will serve? Not without a
"concerted effort. In 2009-2010, 12 percent of Virginia’s teachers are black, two percent are"
"Hispanic, and one percent are Asian, compared with approximately 25, nine, and six percent"
"of students, respectively."
Promoting Parental and Family Involvement
The family and the home are both critical education institutions where children begin
"learning long before they start school, and where they spend much of their time after they"
start school. It stands to reason that involving parents in their child’s education is conducive
to learning. Such involvement is critical if we are to improve the educational achievement of
"Virginia’s students, promote safe and healthy school environments, and eliminate"
"achievement gaps. To do this, schools need to promote and enhance cooperative"
partnerships in which families are allies in the efforts of teachers and schools.

New Initiatives for 2010
The Board of Education is firmly committed to providing leadership to help schools and
divisions meet higher standards for all students. Legislation proposed by Governor Robert
F. McDonnell and approved by the 2010 General Assembly creates additional opportunities
for students to learn and gives the Board of Education responsibility to implement the
provisions of the new programs.
"New Initiatives: Charter Schools, College Partnership Laboratory Schools, and"
Online Providers
"As a springboard for action, the President of the Board of Education, Mrs. Eleanor B."
"Saslaw, established two new committees to focus attention on priorities for action: the"
Charter School Committee and the College Partnership Laboratory School Committee. The
"committees consist of members of the Board, and the chairs of the respective committees"
have set an agenda for action that will move the Board closer to meeting its goal of
"expanding learning opportunities for all students. Also, the Board has supported the work"
related to two new initiatives undertaken by the Virginia Department of Education that
directly relate to the priorities of the Board.
Charter School Committee:
Charter schools provide options for parents and students while allowing communities and
educators to create innovative instructional programs that can be replicated elsewhere in the
public school system. All charter schools in Virginia are nonsectarian alternative public
schools located within a school division and under the authority of a local school board. To
"carry out its responsibilities, the Board’s Charter School Committee was formed and set to"
work immediately to develop or revise the following: procedures for receiving and reviewing
charter school applications; criteria used in reviewing applications; a listing of regulations
that may be waived for charter schools; and criteria for making distributions from the charter
"school fund. During its deliberations, the committee held informative discussions with a"
"panel of national experts, followed by panels of leaders of statewide organizations. It is"
"anticipated that the procedures, criteria, and regulations will be adopted by the Board at the"
January 2011 meeting.
College Partnership Laboratory School Committee:
College partnership laboratory schools are public schools established by contract between
the governing board of a college or university and the Board of Education. The 2010
legislation allows any public institution of higher education in the Commonwealth with an
approved teacher-preparation program to establish a college partnership laboratory school.
The Board’s College Partnership Laboratory School Committee was established and is in the
process of developing the following: procedures for receiving college partnership laboratory
school applications; an application and criteria used in reviewing applications; a listing of
regulations that may be waived; and criteria for making distributions from the college
partnership laboratory fund.
2010 Annual Report on Condition and Needs of Public Schools
Page 19
The committee began its work by convening a panel of nationally recognized experts in the
"college laboratory field, followed by discussions with Virginia college and university"
"provosts, deans, and directors of teacher education programs. Final recommendations on"
procedures and criteria will be made by the Board at the January 2011 meeting.
Multidivision Online Providers:
"Also new in legislation for 2010, the Superintendent of Public Instruction is required to"
"develop, and the Board is required to approve, criteria for approving and monitoring"
multidivision online providers of virtual school programs. It allows local school boards to
enter into contracts with approved multidivision online providers to deliver virtual
programs.
"""Multidivision online provider"" means (i) a private or nonprofit organization that enters into"
a contract with a local school board to provide online courses or programs through that
school board to students who reside in Virginia both within and outside the geographical
boundaries of that school division; (ii) a private or nonprofit organization that enters into
contracts with multiple local school boards to provide online courses or programs to
students in grades K through 12 through those school boards; or (iii) a local school board
that provides online courses or programs to students who reside in Virginia but outside the
geographical boundaries of that school division.
"The Superintendent must develop model policies for school divisions, and the Board must"
submit information about virtual school programs in its annual report to the Governor and
"to the General Assembly, beginning in November 2011. In October 2010, the Board"
approved the first set of multidivision online providers and will report on these providers
and any subsequent additions in its annual report for 2011.
Support for Virginia Department of Education Initiatives
College and Career Readiness Initiative:
"Being developed and implemented by the Virginia Department of Education (VDOE), the"
Virginia College and Career Readiness Initiative (CCRI) builds on the revised Standards of
"Learning in mathematics and English adopted in 2009 and 2010, respectively. The revised"
standards reflect the substantial input and recommended changes provided by college faculty
"and other experts from the College Board, ACT, the American Diploma Project, and the"
business community. These groups support Virginia’s revisions and have validated the
standards as college and career ready. The Virginia College and Career Readiness Initiative
builds on the revised standards and is designed to:
"(1) Ensure that college and career ready learning standards in reading, writing, and"
mathematics are taught in every Virginia high school classroom; and
(2) Strengthen students’ preparation for college and the work force before leaving high
school.
2010 Annual Report on Condition and Needs of Public Schools
Page 20
The findings so far of the College and Career Readiness Initiative show the indicators of
"college readiness. In short, students who meet the following indicators are likely to enroll in"
"college, and upon enrollment, be permitted to enter directly into entry-level, credit-bearing"
courses in college:

"In addition, participating in Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, and dual"
enrollment courses in high school further reduces the likelihood that students will be placed
in developmental coursework in college.
Study and Development of Model Teacher and Administrator Evaluation Systems: The
Board of Education has received updates on the Virginia Department of Education’s
comprehensive study of teacher and administrator evaluation. This study is designed to:
(1) Provide models that may be used by school divisions to develop differentiated or
performance-based compensation systems; and
(2) Provide revised guidance documents and new evaluation models for teachers that
can be used in school divisions to improve student achievement by improving
"teacher performance, increasing teacher retention, and developing meaningful,"
targeted professional development.
The study will target divisions with high-poverty schools and persistently low-performing
schools as initial pilot sites for revised evaluation models. The department plans to complete
the Guidance documents and evaluation models in December 2010 and present the
documents to the Board of Education in January and February 2011.
The Board’s Performance Measures:
Addressing the Needs of Virginia’s Public Schools
The Board of Education has adopted a comprehensive plan of action for the coming years.
More details for the plan of action may be found in the Board of Education’s Comprehensive
"Plan: 2007-2012, which may be viewed on the Board of Education’s Web site at the"
following address:
http://www.doe.virginia.gov/VDOE/VA_Board/comprehensiveplan.pdf. It outlines eight
"goals (discussed in more detail below), along with strategies and activities that will provide"
the framework for the Board of Education’s focus for the near future. The goals will be
updated in early 2011. The following goals were set by the Board to address the complex
challenges that impact our schools and our young people.
2010 Annual Report on Condition and Needs of Public Schools
Page 21
Objective 1: The Board of Education will continue to
enhance the quality standards for all public schools in
Virginia.
"From 2008 to 2010, the Board adopted revised Standards of Learning (SOL) in mathematics,"
"English, science, and history and social science. During the revisions of the mathematics"
"and English standards in particular, there was a substantial effort made to work with outside"
"experts to establish Standards of Learning that, if mastered, would prepare students for"
success in college and careers. The mathematics and English standards reflect the
substantial input and recommended changes provided by college faculty and other experts
"from the College Board, ACT, the American Diploma Project, and the business community."
These groups support Virginia’s revisions and have validated the standards as college and
career ready.
"With the Board’s adoption of these revised standards, the Virginia Department of Education"
(VDOE) is developing new tests that will measure students’ mastery of the more rigorous
content standards. The new mathematics and English assessments will be administered
"online, and include technology-enhanced items that require students to demonstrate content"
mastery in ways that were not possible with multiple-choice tests. The result of the
"standards revision, therefore, will be that students will have to demonstrate mastery of more"
rigorous content in mathematics and English in order to pass the revised SOL tests.
"In addition to the standards revisions, VDOE is developing the new tests to enable the"
Board to establish college ready achievement levels on certain end-of-course assessments in
English and mathematics.. The college ready achievement level will replace advanced
proficiency on certain end-of-course tests. The addition of a college ready cut score on
certain end-of-course mathematics and English assessments is part of the Virginia College
and Career Readiness Initiative.
Highlights: Actions To meet Objective 1
"The Board of Education regularly reviews and revises the Standards of Quality (SOQ),"
"Standards of Accreditation (SOA), and Standards of Learning (SOL). Throughout this"
"process, the Board collects data and information that support its ability to thoughtfully and"
deliberately make revisions that are designed to enhance the quality of the standards to
which Virginia’s students are held.
"In 2010, the Board adopted revised Standards of Learning for English and Science, along"
with revised curriculum frameworks for these core subjects. The Board also adopted the
curriculum framework for its Economics and Personal Finance Standards of Learning.
"In June 2010, the Board of Education reaffirmed its intention that the academic standards"
for Virginia’s schools shall be second to none. Much has been made in media reports about
the Common Core State Standards. The Board of Education is committed to the Virginia
Standards of Learning program and opposed a word-for-word adoption of the newly
developed Common Core State Standards as a prerequisite for participation in federal
competitive grant and entitlement programs.

percent of core classes in low-poverty schools.
While Virginia has made great strides towards distributing highly qualified teachers evenly
"across high- and low-poverty schools, less is known about the effectiveness of such"
"educators. In 2010, the Virginia Department of Education (VDOE) established a"
"workgroup to build models for performance evaluation that, when used appropriately, will"
"allow school divisions to identify more and less effective educators, and provide all teachers"
"with professional development opportunities that focus on their needs, as identified through"
evaluation. Part of the workgroup’s charge is to update the Board of Education’s guidance
document on teacher performance standards and evaluation criteria. Completing this work
will position Virginia to remain competitive in bringing federal funds for teachers to
Virginia’s schools.
VDOE is also working to provide mathematics and English teachers in tested grades with
information about the growth of their students based on SOL test scores. Virginia’s growth
"measure, which will be available in 2011, will provide teachers with information about the"
"progress of their students, relative to other students with similar achievement the previous"
year. This information will help teachers and administrators understand how much progress
their students make each year. When used appropriately as one component of
"comprehensive performance evaluation, the growth measure can provide information about"
the contribution of teacher activities to student progress.
Highlights: Actions of the Board in 2010 to Meet Objective 6:
The Board of Education adopted a number of new or revised provisions regarding teacher
"training and licensure requirements, including:"
(1) Revising the passing score for the School Leaders Licensure Assessment (SLLA);
(2) Approving several college and university new endorsement areas and professional
education programs;
(3) Revising and updating several requirements related to teacher pre-service
assessments (Praxis I and Praxis II);
(4) Adopting test options for native speakers or for teacher candidates who have learned
a foreign language without formal academic credit to meet the endorsement
requirements in these languages; and
(5) Adopting an assessment for those seeking an initial Virginia license with the
endorsement in Special Education-Visual Impairments

The Virginia Department of Education has provided its own research and resources by
"developing a study focusing on the use of online, interactive, story-based lessons on various"
"Internet safety issues, including cyberbullying. T he resulting research, presented at annual"
"meeting of the American Educational Research Association, demonstrated that these lessons"
"had a positive impact on the behavior of fourth grade students. Subsequently, this project"
has been continued using Garfield characters and created in cooperation with the Professor
Garfield Foundation.
The department has also researched and published two information briefs to inform schools
about the latest research. The briefs help divisions update their own policies and procedures
relating to current issues. Both were developed in conjunction with the Office of the
Attorney General of Virginia.
"These anti-bullying efforts may be paying off. According to the data, the number of bullying"
incidents had been relatively stable from 2006-2007 through 2008-2009. In the 2009-2010
"school year, which is the most recent data available, there were 1191 fewer incidents, or a"
"reduction of 18 percent, of bullying offenses reported to VDOE from the school divisions."
This also reflected 16 percent fewer individual student offenders being involved in reported
bullying offenses. The department is working closely with school divisions on this issue and
looks forward to seeing if this is an ongoing trend.
The Board of Education is developing Guidelines for the Prevention of Sexual Misconduct and Abuse
in Virginia Public Schools to help school divisions meet their obligation under the law and
create and implement policies and procedures that establish clear and reasonable boundaries
"for interactions between students and teachers, other school board employees, and adult"
volunteers. The model policies and best practices in the document draw from policies and
legislation approved by school boards and legislatures in other states and policies and best
practices implemented by private and parochial schools and national youth-service
organizations.
"On the student health front, the Board of Education worked with the state’s health care"
leaders and other interested stakeholders in conducting the research necessary for the
development of guidelines for concussions in student-athletes.
Compliance with the Requirements of the
Standards of Quality
Section 22.1-18 of the Code of Virginia requires the Board of Education to “identify any
school divisions and the specific schools therein which have failed to establish and maintain
schools meeting the existing prescribed standards of quality.”
Ninety-four divisions reported full compliance with the provisions of the Standards of
Quality (SOQ) in the 2009-2010 school year. Appendix B contains a list of school divisions
that have reported non-compliance with any of the provisions of the SOQ. The appendix
also provides additional information on the status of compliance over the last three years for
"these divisions. Students in 1,814 of the Commonwealth’s 1,850 schools met or exceeded"
2010 Annual Report on Condition and Needs of Public Schools
Page 33
state achievement objectives on Standards of Learning (SOL) tests and other statewide
assessments in the four core academic areas last year.
"Each year, the Department of Education collects self-assessment data from school divisions"
on their compliance with the provisions of § 22.1-253.13:1 through 22.1-253.13:8 of the Code
of Virginia (Standards of Quality). The chairman of the school board and division
superintendent certify the level of compliance with the standards and the individual
indicators within each standard to the Department of Education via an electronic data
collection system.
"Where divisions indicate less than full compliance with the standards, corrective action plans"
for the noncompliance items are required. See Appendix _ for a listing of the information
and data used by the Department of Education staff to monitor and verify compliance. Of
"the divisions that were not in full compliance, all have filed a corrective action plan. The data"
are for the 2009-2010 school year and for the Standards of Quality that were in effect as of
"July 1, 2009."
Compliance with the Requirements of the
Standards of Accreditation
Ninety-eight percent of Virginia’s public schools are fully accredited and meeting current
"state standards for achievement in English, mathematics, history and science based on 2009-"
2010 assessment results. Another one percent received conditionally accredited ratings
because they are new schools.
The 2010-2011 ratings represent the second consecutive year in which all but two percent of
"Virginia’s public schools are fully accredited. Students in 98 percent of Virginia’s 1,850"
schools met or exceeded state objectives on SOL tests and other statewide assessments in
the four core academic areas. Ninety-eight percent of Virginia’s elementary and middle
schools and 99 percent of the high schools are now fully accredited.
One school – Vernon Johns Junior High in Petersburg – earned full accreditation after being
denied accreditation for three consecutive years.
Three schools earned full accreditation after undergoing reconstitution and being
conditionally accredited for one or more years. These schools are: Lake Taylor Middle and
Northside Middle in Norfolk and Thomas C. Boushall Middle in Richmond.
"Under Virginia's accountability program, a school that has been on academic warning for"
three consecutive years and fails to meet state standards for a fourth consecutive year can
apply to the Board of Education for conditional accreditation – if the local school board
"agrees to reconstitute the school’s leadership, staff, governance or student population. A"
reconstituted school can retain conditional accreditation for up to three years if it is making
acceptable progress toward meeting state standards.
"In 119 of Virginia’s132 school divisions, all schools are fully accredited, compared with 117"
"last year. For a full listing, see Appendix C."
2010 Annual Report on Condition and Needs of Public Schools
Page 34
Requirements Will Become More Rigorous
"Beginning with accreditation ratings to be announced in September 2011, high schools will"
have to meet an annual objective for raising graduation rates to earn full accreditation. In
"September 2012, a pass rate of at least 75 percent in English reading will be required for all"
"grade spans, and the required pass rates for elementary schools in science and history/social"
science will each rise to 70 percent – the same benchmark middle schools and high schools
must meet. The higher pass rates had been scheduled to take effect earlier but were delayed
by the General Assembly.
"In addition, students will take more rigorous SOL mathematics tests beginning in 2011-2012"
"and more rigorous tests in English reading the following year. Taken together, these steps"
will represent a substantial increase in the rigor of Virginia’s accountability program. The
accreditation ratings we will announce a year from now will mark a new beginning as schools
advance toward goals aligned with the latest national expectations for college and career
readiness.
Accreditation ratings may reflect adjustments made for schools that successfully remediate
students who failed reading or mathematics tests during the previous year. Adjustments also
may be made for students with limited-English proficiency and for students who have
recently transferred into a Virginia public school.
Closing Statement by the Virginia Board of Education
The Board of Education’s priorities for action may be summed up as this: Priorities are
based upon a sincere expectation that every child will learn academic content at a high and
"challenging level, that any traditional excuses for failure will be swept off the table, and that"
assessments will be used to guide the next lesson as well as evaluate the previous one.
"In uncovering key components of successfully run schools, research points to strong"
"instructional leadership, a clear focus on academics, regular measures of academic progress,"
"high-quality teaching, and good community and parent relations. The Board’s priorities for"
action clearly address each of these factors.
The world in which we live —and certainly the one in which our children will live and work
"in the future —is constantly changing, constantly shifting. New technologies, higher level"
"skills, and new ways of working emerge every day, and our schools must provide an"
education that promotes excellent opportunities for all children to learn.
Keeping our system of public schools on a steady course and continuing to deliver solid
results despite huge challenges call for a keen sense of what is required to ensure
opportunities for all children to learn. It requires a steady focus on the Board of Education’s
"vision, mission, and goals."
"Education is the foundation for everything else we do, from economic development to"
"health care. We are facing some difficult challenges today, but the key solution to these"
"challenges remains the same: Be measured by rigorous standards, reach rigorous standards,"
"and exceed rigorous standards. By doing so, young Virginians will surely lead the nation in"
educational progress.

"STANDARDS OF QUALITY: EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 2010"
Code of Virginia
§ 22.1-253.13:1. Standard 1. Instructional programs supporting the Standards of Learning and other educational
objectives.
A. The General Assembly and the Board of Education believe that the fundamental goal of the public schools of this
"Commonwealth must be to enable each student to develop the skills that are necessary for success in school, preparation for"
"life, and reaching their full potential. The General Assembly and the Board of Education find that the quality of education is"
"dependent upon the provision of (i) the appropriate working environment, benefits, and salaries necessary to ensure the"
availability of high-quality instructional personnel; (ii) the appropriate learning environment designed to promote student
achievement; (iii) quality instruction that enables each student to become a productive and educated citizen of Virginia and
"the United States of America; and (iv) the adequate commitment of other resources. In keeping with this goal, the General"
"Assembly shall provide for the support of public education as set forth in Article VIII, Section 1 of the Constitution of Virginia."
"B. The Board of Education shall establish educational objectives known as the Standards of Learning, which shall form the"
"core of Virginia's educational program, and other educational objectives, which together are designed to ensure the"
development of the skills that are necessary for success in school and for preparation for life in the years beyond. At a
"minimum, the Board shall establish Standards of Learning for English, mathematics, science, and history and social science."
The Standards of Learning shall not be construed to be regulations as defined in § 2.2-4001.
The Board shall seek to ensure that the Standards of Learning are consistent with a high-quality foundation educational
"program. The Standards of Learning shall include, but not be limited to, the basic skills of communication (listening, speaking,"
"reading, and writing); computation and critical reasoning including problem solving and decision making; proficiency in the"
use of computers and related technology; and the skills to manage personal finances and to make sound financial decisions.
The English Standards of Learning for reading in kindergarten through grade three shall be based on components of effective
"reading instruction, to include, at a minimum, phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary development, and text"
comprehension.
The Standards of Learning in all subject areas shall be subject to regular review and revision to maintain rigor and to reflect a
balance between content knowledge and the application of knowledge in preparation for eventual employment and lifelong
"learning. The Board of Education shall establish a regular schedule, in a manner it deems appropriate, for the review, and"
"revision as may be necessary, of the Standards of Learning in all subject areas. Such review of each subject area shall occur"
at least once every seven years. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the Board from conducting such review
and revision on a more frequent basis.
"To provide appropriate opportunity for input from the general public, teachers, and local school boards, the Board of"
Education shall conduct public hearings prior to establishing revised Standards of Learning. Thirty days prior to conducting
"such hearings, the Board shall give notice of the date, time, and place of the hearings to all local school boards and any other"
persons requesting to be notified of the hearings and publish notice of its intention to revise the Standards of Learning in the
Virginia Register of Regulations. Interested parties shall be given reasonable opportunity to be heard and present information
prior to final adoption of any revisions of the Standards of Learning.
"In addition, the Department of Education shall make available and maintain a website, either separately or through an"
"existing website utilized by the Department of Education, enabling public elementary, middle, and high school educators to"
"submit recommendations for improvements relating to the Standards of Learning, when under review by the Board according"
"to its established schedule, and related assessments required by the Standards of Quality pursuant to this chapter. Such"
website shall facilitate the submission of recommendations by educators.
School boards shall implement the Standards of Learning or objectives specifically designed for their school divisions that are
equivalent to or exceed the Board's requirements. Students shall be expected to achieve the educational objectives
established by the school division at appropriate age or grade levels. The curriculum adopted by the local school division
shall be aligned to the Standards of Learning.
2010 Annual Report on Condition and Needs of Public Schools
Page 49
The Board of Education shall include in the Standards of Learning for history and social science the study of contributions to
"society of diverse people. For the purposes of this subsection, ""diverse"" shall include consideration of disability, ethnicity,"
"race, and gender."
"With such funds as are made available for this purpose, the Board shall regularly review and revise the competencies for"
"career and technical education programs to require the full integration of English, mathematics, science, and history and"
social science Standards of Learning. Career and technical education programs shall be aligned with industry and
"professional standard certifications, where they exist."
C. Local school boards shall develop and implement a program of instruction for grades K through 12 that is aligned to the
Standards of Learning and meets or exceeds the requirements of the Board of Education. The program of instruction shall
"emphasize reading, writing, speaking, mathematical concepts and computations, proficiency in the use of computers and"
"related technology, and scientific concepts and processes; essential skills and concepts of citizenship, including knowledge of"
"Virginia history and world and United States history, economics, government, foreign languages, international cultures, health"
"and physical education, environmental issues and geography necessary for responsible participation in American society and"
"in the international community; fine arts, which may include, but need not be limited to, music and art, and practical arts;"
"knowledge and skills needed to qualify for further education, gainful employment, or training in a career or technical field; and"
development of the ability to apply such skills and knowledge in preparation for eventual employment and lifelong learning
and to achieve economic self-sufficiency.
"Local school boards shall also develop and implement programs of prevention, intervention, or remediation for students who"
"are educationally at risk including, but not limited to, those who fail to achieve a passing score on any Standards of Learning"
assessment in grades three through eight or who fail an end-of-course test required for the award of a verified unit of credit.
Such programs shall include components that are research-based.
"Any student who achieves a passing score on one or more, but not all, of the Standards of Learning assessments for the"
relevant grade level in grades three through eight may be required to attend a remediation program.
Any student who fails to achieve a passing score on all of the Standards of Learning assessments for the relevant grade level
in grades three through eight or who fails an end-of-course test required for the award of a verified unit of credit shall be
required to attend a remediation program or to participate in another form of remediation. Division superintendents shall
"require such students to take special programs of prevention, intervention, or remediation, which may include attendance in"
"public summer school programs, in accordance with clause (ii) of subsection A of § 22.1-254 and § 22.1-254.01."
"Remediation programs shall include, when applicable, a procedure for early identification of students who are at risk of failing"
the Standards of Learning assessments in grades three through eight or who fail an end-of-course test required for the award
of a verified unit of credit. Such programs may also include summer school for all elementary and middle school grades and
"for all high school academic courses, as defined by regulations promulgated by the Board of Education, or other forms of"
remediation. Summer school remediation programs or other forms of remediation shall be chosen by the division
superintendent to be appropriate to the academic needs of the student. Students who are required to attend such summer
school programs or to participate in another form of remediation shall not be charged tuition by the school division.
"The requirement for remediation may, however, be satisfied by the student's attendance in a program of prevention,"
"intervention or remediation that has been selected by his parent, in consultation with the division superintendent or his"
"designee, and is either (i) conducted by an accredited private school or (ii) a special program that has been determined to be"
comparable to the required public school remediation program by the division superintendent. The costs of such private
school remediation program or other special remediation program shall be borne by the student's parent.
"The Board of Education shall establish standards for full funding of summer remedial programs that shall include, but not be"
"limited to, the minimum number of instructional hours or the equivalent thereof required for full funding and an assessment"
system designed to evaluate program effectiveness. Based on the number of students attending and the Commonwealth's
"share of the per pupil instructional costs, state funds shall be provided for the full cost of summer and other remediation"
2010 Annual Report on Condition and Needs of Public Schools
Page 50
"programs as set forth in the appropriation act, provided such programs comply with such standards as shall be established by"
"the Board, pursuant to § 22.1-199.2."
D. Local school boards shall also implement the following:
1. Programs in grades K through three that emphasize developmentally appropriate learning to enhance success.
"2. Programs based on prevention, intervention, or remediation designed to increase the number of students who earn a high"
school diploma and to prevent students from dropping out of school. Such programs shall include components that are
research-based.
3. Career and technical education programs incorporated into the K through 12 curricula that include:
"a. Knowledge of careers and all types of employment opportunities including, but not limited to, apprenticeships,"
"entrepreneurship and small business ownership, the military, and the teaching profession, and emphasize the advantages of"
completing school with marketable skills;
b. Career exploration opportunities in the middle school grades; and
"c. Competency-based career and technical education programs that integrate academic outcomes, career guidance and job-"
seeking skills for all secondary students. Programs must be based upon labor market needs and student interest. Career
guidance shall include counseling about available employment opportunities and placement services for students exiting
school. Each school board shall develop and implement a plan to ensure compliance with the provisions of this subdivision.
Such plan shall be developed with the input of area business and industry representatives and local community colleges and
shall be submitted to the Superintendent of Public Instruction in accordance with the timelines established by federal law.
4. Educational objectives in middle and high school that emphasize economic education and financial literacy pursuant to §
22.1-200.03.
5. Early identification of students with disabilities and enrollment of such students in appropriate instructional programs
consistent with state and federal law.
6. Early identification of gifted students and enrollment of such students in appropriately differentiated instructional programs.
7. Educational alternatives for students whose needs are not met in programs prescribed elsewhere in these standards. Such
students shall be counted in average daily membership (ADM) in accordance with the regulations of the Board of Education.
8. Adult education programs for individuals functioning below the high school completion level. Such programs may be
conducted by the school board as the primary agency or through a collaborative arrangement between the school board and
other agencies.
9. A plan to make achievements for students who are educationally at risk a divisionwide priority that shall include procedures
for measuring the progress of such students.
"10. A plan to notify students and their parents of the availability of dual enrollment and advanced placement classes, the"
"International Baccalaureate Program, and Academic Year Governor's School Programs, the qualifications for enrolling in"
"such classes and programs, and the availability of financial assistance to low-income and needy students to take the"
advanced placement and International Baccalaureate examinations.
11. Identification of students with limited English proficiency and enrollment of such students in appropriate instructional
programs.
2010 Annual Report on Condition and Needs of Public Schools
Page 51
"12. Early identification, diagnosis, and assistance for students with reading and mathematics problems and provision of"
instructional strategies and reading and mathematics practices that benefit the development of reading and mathematics
skills for all students.
"13. Incorporation of art, music, and physical education as a part of the instructional program at the elementary school level."
14. A program of physical fitness available to all students with a goal of at least 150 minutes per week on average during the
"regular school year. Such program may include any combination of (i) physical education classes, (ii) extracurricular athletics,"
or (iii) other programs and physical activities deemed appropriate by the local school board. Each local school board shall
incorporate into its local wellness policy a goal for the implementation of such program during the regular school year.
15. A program of student services for grades kindergarten through 12 that shall be designed to aid students in their
"educational, social, and career development."
16. The collection and analysis of data and the use of the results to evaluate and make decisions about the instructional

"E. From such funds as may be appropriated or otherwise received for such purpose, there shall be established within the"
Department of Education a unit to (i) conduct evaluative studies; (ii) provide the resources and technical assistance to
increase the capacity for school divisions to deliver quality instruction; and (iii) assist school divisions in implementing those
programs and practices that will enhance pupil academic performance and improve family and community involvement in the
public schools. Such unit shall identify and analyze effective instructional programs and practices and professional
development initiatives; evaluate the success of programs encouraging parental and family involvement; assess changes in
student outcomes prompted by family involvement; and collect and disseminate among school divisions information regarding
"effective instructional programs and practices, initiatives promoting family and community involvement, and potential funding"
and support sources. Such unit may also provide resources supporting professional development for administrators and
"teachers. In providing such information, resources, and other services to school divisions, the unit shall give priority to those"
divisions demonstrating a less than 70 percent passing rate on the Standards of Learning assessments.
"§ 22.1-253.13:2. Standard 2. Instructional, administrative, and support personnel."
"A. The Board shall establish requirements for the licensing of teachers, principals, superintendents, and other professional"
personnel.
B. School boards shall employ licensed instructional personnel qualified in the relevant subject areas.

"Within its regulations governing special education programs, the Board shall seek to set pupil/teacher ratios for pupils with"
mental retardation that do not exceed the pupil/teacher ratios for self-contained classes for pupils with specific learning
disabilities.
"Further, school boards shall assign instructional personnel in a manner that produces schoolwide ratios of students in"
average daily memberships to full-time equivalent teaching positions of 21 to one in middle schools and high schools. School
"divisions shall provide all middle and high school teachers with one planning period per day or the equivalent, unencumbered"
of any teaching or supervisory duties.
2010 Annual Report on Condition and Needs of Public Schools
Page 52

The Board shall review annually the accreditation status of all schools in the Commonwealth.
Each local school board shall maintain schools that are fully accredited pursuant to the standards for accreditation as
prescribed by the Board of Education. Each local school board shall review the accreditation status of all schools in the local
"school division annually in public session. Within the time specified by the Board of Education, each school board shall"
submit corrective action plans for any schools within its school division that have been designated as not meeting the
standards as approved by the Board.
When the Board of Education has obtained evidence through the school academic review process that the failure of schools
"within a division to achieve full accreditation status is related to division level failure to implement the Standards of Quality,"
the Board may require a division level academic review. After the conduct of such review and within the time specified by the
"Board of Education, each school board shall submit for approval by the Board a corrective action plan, consistent with criteria"
established by the Board and setting forth specific actions and a schedule designed to ensure that schools within its school
division achieve full accreditation status. Such corrective action plans shall be part of the relevant school division's
comprehensive plan pursuant to § 22.1-253.13:6.
"With such funds as are appropriated or otherwise received for this purpose, the Board shall adopt and implement an"
"academic review process, to be conducted by the Department of Education, to assist schools that are accredited with"
"warning. The Department shall forward a report of each academic review to the relevant local school board, and such school"
board shall report the results of such academic review and the required annual progress reports in public session. The local
school board shall implement any actions identified through the academic review and utilize them for improvement planning.
B. The Superintendent of Public Instruction shall develop and the Board of Education shall approve criteria for determining
"and recognizing educational performance in the Commonwealth's public school divisions and schools. Such criteria, when"
"approved, shall become an integral part of the accreditation process and shall include student outcome measurements. The"
Superintendent of Public Instruction shall annually identify to the Board those school divisions and schools that exceed or do
not meet the approved criteria. Such identification shall include an analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of public
education programs in the various school divisions in Virginia and recommendations to the General Assembly for further
enhancing student learning uniformly across the Commonwealth. In recognizing educational performance in the school
"divisions, the Board shall include consideration of special school division accomplishments, such as numbers of dual"
"enrollments and students in Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate courses, and participation in academic"
year Governor's Schools.
The Superintendent of Public Instruction shall assist local school boards in the implementation of action plans for increasing
educational performance in those school divisions and schools that are identified as not meeting the approved criteria. The
Superintendent of Public Instruction shall monitor the implementation of and report to the Board of Education on the
effectiveness of the corrective actions taken to improve the educational performance in such school divisions and schools.
"C. With such funds as are available for this purpose, the Board of Education shall prescribe assessment methods to"
determine the level of achievement of the Standards of Learning objectives by all students. Such assessments shall evaluate
"knowledge, application of knowledge, critical thinking, and skills related to the Standards of Learning being assessed. The"
"Board shall (i) in consultation with the chairpersons of the eight regional superintendents' study groups, establish a timetable"
for administering the Standards of Learning assessments to ensure genuine end-of-course and end-of-grade testing and (ii)
"with the assistance of independent testing experts, conduct a regular analysis and validation process for these assessments."
"In prescribing such Standards of Learning assessments, the Board shall provide local school boards the option of"
"administering tests for United States History to 1877, United States History: 1877 to the Present, and Civics and Economics."
The last administration of the cumulative grade eight history test will be during the 2007-2008 academic school year.
"Beginning with the 2008-2009 academic year, all school divisions shall administer the United States History to 1877, United"
"States History: 1877 to the Present, and Civics and Economics tests. The Board shall also provide the option of industry"
certification and state licensure examinations as a student-selected verified credit.
The Board of Education shall make publicly available such assessments in a timely manner and as soon as practicable
"following the administration of such tests, so long as the release of such assessments does not compromise test security or"
2010 Annual Report on Condition and Needs of Public Schools
Page 55
"deplete the bank of assessment questions necessary to construct subsequent tests, or limit the ability to test students on"
demand and provide immediate results in the web-based assessment system.
The Board shall include in the student outcome measures that are required by the Standards for Accreditation end-of-course
"or end-of-grade tests for various grade levels and classes, as determined by the Board, in accordance with the Standards of"
"Learning. These Standards of Learning assessments shall include, but need not be limited to, end-of-course or end-of-grade"
"tests for English, mathematics, science, and history and social science."
"In addition, to assess the educational progress of students, the Board of Education shall (i) develop appropriate"
"assessments, which may include criterion-referenced tests and alternative assessment instruments that may be used by"
classroom teachers; (ii) select appropriate industry certification and state licensure examinations and (iii) prescribe and
"provide measures, which may include nationally normed tests to be used to identify students who score in the bottom quartile"
at selected grade levels. An annual justification that includes evidence that the student meets the participation criteria defined
by the Virginia Department of Education shall be provided for each student considered for the Virginia Grade Level
Alternative. Each Individual Education Program team shall review such justification and make the final determination as to
whether or not the Virginia Grade Level Alternative is appropriate for the student. The superintendent and the school board
"chairman shall certify to the Board of Education, as a part of certifying compliance with the Standards of Quality, that there is"
a justification in the Individual Education Program for every student who takes the Virginia Grade Level Alternative.
Compliance with this requirement shall be monitored as a part of the special education monitoring process conducted by the
Department of Education. The Board shall report to the Governor and General Assembly in its annual reports pursuant to §
22.1-18 any school division that is not in compliance with this requirement.
"The Standard of Learning requirements, including all related assessments, shall be waived for any student awarded a"
"scholarship under the Brown v. Board of Education Scholarship Program, pursuant to § 30-231.2, who is enrolled in a"
preparation program for the General Education Development (GED) certificate or in an adult basic education program to
obtain the high school diploma.
The Board of Education may adopt special provisions related to the administration and use of any SOL test or tests in a
content area as applied to accreditation ratings for any period during which the SOL content or assessments in that area are
"being revised and phased in. Prior to statewide administration of such tests, the Board of Education shall provide notice to"
local school boards regarding such special provisions.
D. The Board of Education may pursue all available civil remedies pursuant to § 22.1-19.1 or administrative action pursuant
to § 22.1-292.1 for breaches in test security and unauthorized alteration of test materials or test results.
"The Board may initiate or cause to be initiated a review or investigation of any alleged breach in security, unauthorized"
"alteration, or improper administration of tests by local school board employees responsible for the distribution or"
administration of the tests.
Records and other information furnished to or prepared by the Board during the conduct of a review or investigation may be
"withheld pursuant to subdivision 12 of § 2.2-3705.3. However, this section shall not prohibit the disclosure of records to (i) a"
local school board or division superintendent for the purpose of permitting such board or superintendent to consider or to take
"personnel action with regard to an employee or (ii) any requester, after the conclusion of a review or investigation, in a form"
that (a) does not reveal the identity of any person making a complaint or supplying information to the Board on a confidential
basis and (b) does not compromise the security of any test mandated by the Board. Any local school board or division
"superintendent receiving such records or other information shall, upon taking personnel action against a relevant employee,"
place copies of such records or information relating to the specific employee in such person's personnel file.
"Notwithstanding any other provision of state law, no test or examination authorized by this section, including the Standards of"
"Learning assessments, shall be released or required to be released as minimum competency tests, if, in the judgment of the"
"Board, such release would breach the security of such test or examination or deplete the bank of questions necessary to"
construct future secure tests.

remediation and (ii) the development of a remediation item bank directly related to the Standards of Learning.
"F. To assess the educational progress of students as individuals and as groups, each local school board shall require the use"
"of Standards of Learning assessments and other relevant data, such as industry certification and state licensure"
"examinations, to evaluate student progress and to determine educational performance. Each local school shall require the"
"administration of appropriate assessments to all students for grade levels and courses identified by the Board of Education,"
"which may include criterion-referenced tests, teacher-made tests and alternative assessment instruments and shall include"
the Standards of Learning Assessments and the National Assessment of Educational Progress state-by-state assessment.
"Each school board shall analyze and report annually, in compliance with any criteria that may be established by the Board of"
"Education, the results from the Stanford Achievement Test Series, Ninth Edition (Stanford Nine) assessment, if administered,"

each year as part of the Board's requirements relating to the School Performance Report Card. Such scores shall be
disaggregated for each school by student subgroups on the Virginia assessment program as appropriate and shall be
reported to the public within three months of their receipt. These reports (i) shall be posted on the portion of the Department
"of Education's website relating to the School Performance Report Card, in a format and in a manner that allows year-to-year"
"comparisons, and (ii) may include the National Assessment of Educational Progress state-by-state assessment."

Noncompliance with the Standards of Quality shall be included in the Board of Education's annual report to the Governor and
the General Assembly as required by § 22.1-18.
"As required by § 22.1-18, the Board of Education shall submit to the Governor and the General Assembly a report on the"
condition and needs of public education in the Commonwealth and shall identify any school divisions and the specific schools
therein that have failed to establish and maintain schools meeting the existing prescribed Standards of Quality.
The Board of Education shall have authority to seek school division compliance with the foregoing Standards of Quality.
"When the Board of Education determines that a school division has failed or refused, and continues to fail or refuse, to"
"comply with any such Standard, the Board may petition the circuit court having jurisdiction in the school division to mandate"
"or otherwise enforce compliance with such standard, including the development or implementation of any required corrective"
action plan that a local school board has failed or refused to develop or implement in a timely manner.
§ 22.1-253.13:9. Virginia Index of Performance incentive program.

recognize and reward fully accredited schools and school divisions that make significant progress toward achieving advanced
"proficiency levels in reading, mathematics, science, and history and social science, and on other indicators of school and"
student performance that are aligned with the Commonwealth's goals for public education. Such recognition may include:
1. Public announcements recognizing individual schools and divisions;
2. Tangible rewards;
3. Waivers of certain board regulations;
4. Exemptions from certain reporting requirements; or
5. Other commendations deemed appropriate to recognize high achievement.
"In addition to Board recognition, local school boards shall adopt policies to recognize individual schools through public"
announcements or media releases as well as other appropriate recognition.
B. A school that maintains a passing rate on Virginia assessment program tests or additional tests approved by the Board of
"95 percent or above in each of the four core academic areas for two consecutive years may, upon application to the"
"Department of Education, receive a waiver from annual accreditation. A school receiving such a waiver shall be fully"
"accredited for a three-year period. However, such school shall continue to annually submit documentation in compliance with"
the pre-accreditation eligibility requirements.
C. Schools may be eligible to receive the Governor's Award for Outstanding Achievement. This award will be given to schools
rated fully accredited that significantly increase the achievement of students within student subgroups in accordance with
guidelines prescribed by the Board of Education.
