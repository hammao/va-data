"95 percent or above in each of the four core academic areas for two consecutive years may, upon application to the"
"Department of Education, receive a waiver from annual accreditation. A school receiving such a waiver shall be fully"
"accredited for a three-year period. However, such school shall continue to annually submit documentation in compliance with"
the pre-accreditation eligibility requirements.
C. Schools may be eligible to receive the Governor's Award for Outstanding Achievement. This award will be given to schools
rated fully accredited that significantly increase the achievement of students within student subgroups in accordance with
guidelines prescribed by the Board of Education.
