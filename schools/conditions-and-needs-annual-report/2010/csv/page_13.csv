Important National Comparisons: Virginia Students Increase Achievement in
"Critical Reading, Mathematics, and Writing"
Results from national reading tests show that Virginia elementary and middle school
students continue to outperform their peers nationwide and are among the nation’s strongest
readers. The average reading scores of Virginia students on the 2009 National Assessment of
"Education Progress (NAEP) – also known as ""The Nation’s Report Card"" – were"
significantly higher than the average scores of their national and regional peers.
"While Virginia students again ranked among the nation’s highest achievers, the 2009 NAEP"
results show that overall achievement among Virginia fourth graders is similar to
"achievement in 2002, while the overall average reading score for eighth graders has declined."
Virginia Students Outperform Peers Nationwide on SAT
Virginia’s 2010 public school graduates increased their achievement and outperformed their
"peers nationwide on all three sections of the SAT college-admissions test, according to the"
"College Board. In the last ten years, average scores of Virginia public school students on the"
SAT have increased by five points in reading and 15 points in mathematics. This compares
with a national decline of four points in reading and a gain of one point in mathematics.
Black and Hispanic Virginia public school graduates increased their achievement and
outperformed their peers nationwide on all three SAT subsections.
Virginia Ranks Among the Top on Advanced Placement Results
The College Board’s February 2010 Advanced Placement Report to the Nation ranked
Virginia third in the nation in achievement on AP examinations. This compares with a
national decline of four points in reading and a gain of one point in mathematics. Moreover
"since 2006, the number of black public school students in Virginia participating in AP testing"
"has increased by 74.4 percent, and the number of Hispanic students taking AP tests has"
increased by 70.2 percent.
Virginia Students Score Higher than Peers on ACT
Virginia public high school graduates achieved significantly higher scores on the ACT this
"year, and the number of public school seniors taking the college-admissions examination"
continued to grow. Public school students in Virginia improved in all subjects. The
percentage of Virginia public school students meeting ACT college-readiness benchmarks
was seven or more points higher than the percentage nationwide.
Six out of 10 Virginia Schools Exceed NCLB Objectives
Six out of 10 Virginia schools exceeded or met all No Child Left Behind (NCLB) objectives
during 2009-2010 despite new accountability provisions related to high school graduation
and the testing of students with disabilities.
Sixty percent of Virginia’s public schools made “adequate yearly progress” (AYP) by
surpassing objectives in reading and mathematics and meeting other indicators of academic
"progress, compared with 71 percent last year."
