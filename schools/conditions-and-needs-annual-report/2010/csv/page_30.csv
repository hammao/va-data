percent of core classes in low-poverty schools.
While Virginia has made great strides towards distributing highly qualified teachers evenly
"across high- and low-poverty schools, less is known about the effectiveness of such"
"educators. In 2010, the Virginia Department of Education (VDOE) established a"
"workgroup to build models for performance evaluation that, when used appropriately, will"
"allow school divisions to identify more and less effective educators, and provide all teachers"
"with professional development opportunities that focus on their needs, as identified through"
evaluation. Part of the workgroup’s charge is to update the Board of Education’s guidance
document on teacher performance standards and evaluation criteria. Completing this work
will position Virginia to remain competitive in bringing federal funds for teachers to
Virginia’s schools.
VDOE is also working to provide mathematics and English teachers in tested grades with
information about the growth of their students based on SOL test scores. Virginia’s growth
"measure, which will be available in 2011, will provide teachers with information about the"
"progress of their students, relative to other students with similar achievement the previous"
year. This information will help teachers and administrators understand how much progress
their students make each year. When used appropriately as one component of
"comprehensive performance evaluation, the growth measure can provide information about"
the contribution of teacher activities to student progress.
Highlights: Actions of the Board in 2010 to Meet Objective 6:
The Board of Education adopted a number of new or revised provisions regarding teacher
"training and licensure requirements, including:"
(1) Revising the passing score for the School Leaders Licensure Assessment (SLLA);
(2) Approving several college and university new endorsement areas and professional
education programs;
(3) Revising and updating several requirements related to teacher pre-service
assessments (Praxis I and Praxis II);
(4) Adopting test options for native speakers or for teacher candidates who have learned
a foreign language without formal academic credit to meet the endorsement
requirements in these languages; and
(5) Adopting an assessment for those seeking an initial Virginia license with the
endorsement in Special Education-Visual Impairments
