K. Local school boards may employ additional positions that exceed these minimal staffing requirements. These additional
"positions may include, but are not limited to, those funded through the state's incentive and categorical programs as set forth"
in the appropriation act.
"L. A combined school, such as kindergarten through 12, shall meet at all grade levels the staffing requirements for the"
"highest grade level in that school; this requirement shall apply to all staff, except for guidance counselors, and shall be based"
"on the school's total enrollment; guidance counselor staff requirements shall, however, be based on the enrollment at the"
"various school organization levels, i.e., elementary, middle, or high school. The Board of Education may grant waivers from"
these staffing levels upon request from local school boards seeking to implement experimental or innovative programs that
are not consistent with these staffing levels.
"M. School boards shall, however, annually, on or before January 1, report to the public the actual pupil/teacher ratios in"
elementary school classrooms by school for the current school year. Such actual ratios shall include only the teachers who
teach the grade and class on a full-time basis and shall exclude resource personnel. School boards shall report pupil/teacher
ratios that include resource teachers in the same annual report. Any classes funded through the voluntary kindergarten
through third grade class size reduction program shall be identified as such classes. Any classes having waivers to exceed
"the requirements of this subsection shall also be identified. Schools shall be identified; however, the data shall be compiled in"
a manner to ensure the confidentiality of all teacher and pupil identities.
N. Students enrolled in a public school on a less than full-time basis shall be counted in ADM in the relevant school division.
"Students who are either (i) enrolled in a nonpublic school or (ii) receiving home instruction pursuant to § 22.1-254.1, and who"
"are enrolled in public school on a less than full-time basis in any mathematics, science, English, history, social science,"
"career and technical education, fine arts, foreign language, or health education or physical education course shall be counted"
in the ADM in the relevant school division on a pro rata basis as provided in the appropriation act. Each such course
"enrollment by such students shall be counted as 0.25 in the ADM; however, no such nonpublic or home school student shall"
be counted as more than one-half a student for purposes of such pro rata calculation. Such calculation shall not include
enrollments of such students in any other public school courses.
O. Each local school board shall provide those support services that are necessary for the efficient and cost-effective
operation and maintenance of its public schools.
"For the purposes of this title, unless the context otherwise requires, ""support services"" shall include services provided by the"
"school board members; the superintendent; assistant superintendents; student services (including guidance counselors,"
"social workers, and homebound, improvement, principal's office, and library-media positions); attendance and health"
"positions; administrative, technical, and clerical positions; operation and maintenance positions; educational technology"
positions; school nurses; and pupil transportation positions.
"Pursuant to the appropriation act, support services shall be funded from basic school aid on the basis of prevailing statewide"
costs.
"P. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, when determining the assignment of instructional and other licensed"
"personnel in subsections C through J, a local school board shall not be required to include full-time students of approved"
virtual school programs.
"§ 22.1-253.13:3. Standard 3. Accreditation, other standards and evaluation."
A. The Board of Education shall promulgate regulations establishing standards for accreditation pursuant to the
"Administrative Process Act (§ 2.2-4000 et seq.), which shall include, but not be limited to, student outcome measures,"
requirements and guidelines for instructional programs and for the integration of educational technology into such
"instructional programs, administrative and instructional staffing levels and positions, including staff positions for supporting"
"educational technology, student services, auxiliary education programs such as library and media services, course and credit"
"requirements for graduation from high school, community relations, and the philosophy, goals, and objectives of public"
education in Virginia.
