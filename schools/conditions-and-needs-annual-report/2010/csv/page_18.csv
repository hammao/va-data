"health and safety of students and staff while they are at school, on school grounds, on their"
"way to or from school, and involved in school-sponsored activities. The Board must"
"continue to stress the importance of successful, communitywide partnerships in the"
"development of procedures and policies that most effectively support healthy, safe, orderly"
and disciplined school environments.
"Preparation, Recruitment, and Retention of Educational Personnel"
The current economic down-turn for the state and the localities will impact teacher
"recruitment and retention. Due to budget limitations, many localities are proceeding with"
"slimmed-down teacher recruitment and hiring. For some divisions, teacher and staff layoffs"
"may be unavoidable. At least in part a result of economic hard times, hiring new teachers"
will likely decrease because current classroom teachers will stay put by holding on to their
"jobs or by deferring retirement. Thus, for the next several years the reality for teacher supply"
and demand is two-fold: available teaching positions will become scarce except for some
"chronic shortage areas, and divisions will struggle to close looming budget gaps, making"
teacher and staff layoffs unavoidable for some.
"Digging deeper for the long term, additional underlying demographics will impact teacher"
recruitment and retention. Finding and retaining qualified teachers in chronic shortage areas
have been persistent problems for many local divisions. Shortage areas include special
"education, mathematics, some foreign languages, and teachers of English as a Second"
"Language. Moreover, approximately one-fifth of our teaching force and one-fourth of the"
principals and assistant principals are aged 55 or older —a significant number of teachers
and principals now at or nearing full retirement age. Antidotal evidence shows a higher-
"than-normal turnover rate for division superintendents, as well. When considered as a"
"whole, these demographics mean challenging times ahead, both short-term and long-term."
Recruiting Minority Teachers
Boosting the diversity of Virginia's teaching staff is crucial at a time when educators are
worrying about eliminating achievement gaps. The gap between the diversity of students in
the schools and the ethnic characteristics of the teaching force poses a key question: will
teachers reflect the tremendous diversity of the students they will serve? Not without a
"concerted effort. In 2009-2010, 12 percent of Virginia’s teachers are black, two percent are"
"Hispanic, and one percent are Asian, compared with approximately 25, nine, and six percent"
"of students, respectively."
Promoting Parental and Family Involvement
The family and the home are both critical education institutions where children begin
"learning long before they start school, and where they spend much of their time after they"
start school. It stands to reason that involving parents in their child’s education is conducive
to learning. Such involvement is critical if we are to improve the educational achievement of
"Virginia’s students, promote safe and healthy school environments, and eliminate"
"achievement gaps. To do this, schools need to promote and enhance cooperative"
partnerships in which families are allies in the efforts of teachers and schools.
