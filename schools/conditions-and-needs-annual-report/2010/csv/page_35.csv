Requirements Will Become More Rigorous
"Beginning with accreditation ratings to be announced in September 2011, high schools will"
have to meet an annual objective for raising graduation rates to earn full accreditation. In
"September 2012, a pass rate of at least 75 percent in English reading will be required for all"
"grade spans, and the required pass rates for elementary schools in science and history/social"
science will each rise to 70 percent – the same benchmark middle schools and high schools
must meet. The higher pass rates had been scheduled to take effect earlier but were delayed
by the General Assembly.
"In addition, students will take more rigorous SOL mathematics tests beginning in 2011-2012"
"and more rigorous tests in English reading the following year. Taken together, these steps"
will represent a substantial increase in the rigor of Virginia’s accountability program. The
accreditation ratings we will announce a year from now will mark a new beginning as schools
advance toward goals aligned with the latest national expectations for college and career
readiness.
Accreditation ratings may reflect adjustments made for schools that successfully remediate
students who failed reading or mathematics tests during the previous year. Adjustments also
may be made for students with limited-English proficiency and for students who have
recently transferred into a Virginia public school.
Closing Statement by the Virginia Board of Education
The Board of Education’s priorities for action may be summed up as this: Priorities are
based upon a sincere expectation that every child will learn academic content at a high and
"challenging level, that any traditional excuses for failure will be swept off the table, and that"
assessments will be used to guide the next lesson as well as evaluate the previous one.
"In uncovering key components of successfully run schools, research points to strong"
"instructional leadership, a clear focus on academics, regular measures of academic progress,"
"high-quality teaching, and good community and parent relations. The Board’s priorities for"
action clearly address each of these factors.
The world in which we live —and certainly the one in which our children will live and work
"in the future —is constantly changing, constantly shifting. New technologies, higher level"
"skills, and new ways of working emerge every day, and our schools must provide an"
education that promotes excellent opportunities for all children to learn.
Keeping our system of public schools on a steady course and continuing to deliver solid
results despite huge challenges call for a keen sense of what is required to ensure
opportunities for all children to learn. It requires a steady focus on the Board of Education’s
"vision, mission, and goals."
"Education is the foundation for everything else we do, from economic development to"
"health care. We are facing some difficult challenges today, but the key solution to these"
"challenges remains the same: Be measured by rigorous standards, reach rigorous standards,"
"and exceed rigorous standards. By doing so, young Virginians will surely lead the nation in"
educational progress.
