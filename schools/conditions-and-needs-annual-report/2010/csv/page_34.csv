state achievement objectives on Standards of Learning (SOL) tests and other statewide
assessments in the four core academic areas last year.
"Each year, the Department of Education collects self-assessment data from school divisions"
on their compliance with the provisions of § 22.1-253.13:1 through 22.1-253.13:8 of the Code
of Virginia (Standards of Quality). The chairman of the school board and division
superintendent certify the level of compliance with the standards and the individual
indicators within each standard to the Department of Education via an electronic data
collection system.
"Where divisions indicate less than full compliance with the standards, corrective action plans"
for the noncompliance items are required. See Appendix _ for a listing of the information
and data used by the Department of Education staff to monitor and verify compliance. Of
"the divisions that were not in full compliance, all have filed a corrective action plan. The data"
are for the 2009-2010 school year and for the Standards of Quality that were in effect as of
"July 1, 2009."
Compliance with the Requirements of the
Standards of Accreditation
Ninety-eight percent of Virginia’s public schools are fully accredited and meeting current
"state standards for achievement in English, mathematics, history and science based on 2009-"
2010 assessment results. Another one percent received conditionally accredited ratings
because they are new schools.
The 2010-2011 ratings represent the second consecutive year in which all but two percent of
"Virginia’s public schools are fully accredited. Students in 98 percent of Virginia’s 1,850"
schools met or exceeded state objectives on SOL tests and other statewide assessments in
the four core academic areas. Ninety-eight percent of Virginia’s elementary and middle
schools and 99 percent of the high schools are now fully accredited.
One school – Vernon Johns Junior High in Petersburg – earned full accreditation after being
denied accreditation for three consecutive years.
Three schools earned full accreditation after undergoing reconstitution and being
conditionally accredited for one or more years. These schools are: Lake Taylor Middle and
Northside Middle in Norfolk and Thomas C. Boushall Middle in Richmond.
"Under Virginia's accountability program, a school that has been on academic warning for"
three consecutive years and fails to meet state standards for a fourth consecutive year can
apply to the Board of Education for conditional accreditation – if the local school board
"agrees to reconstitute the school’s leadership, staff, governance or student population. A"
reconstituted school can retain conditional accreditation for up to three years if it is making
acceptable progress toward meeting state standards.
"In 119 of Virginia’s132 school divisions, all schools are fully accredited, compared with 117"
"last year. For a full listing, see Appendix C."
