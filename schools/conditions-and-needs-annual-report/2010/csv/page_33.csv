The Virginia Department of Education has provided its own research and resources by
"developing a study focusing on the use of online, interactive, story-based lessons on various"
"Internet safety issues, including cyberbullying. T he resulting research, presented at annual"
"meeting of the American Educational Research Association, demonstrated that these lessons"
"had a positive impact on the behavior of fourth grade students. Subsequently, this project"
has been continued using Garfield characters and created in cooperation with the Professor
Garfield Foundation.
The department has also researched and published two information briefs to inform schools
about the latest research. The briefs help divisions update their own policies and procedures
relating to current issues. Both were developed in conjunction with the Office of the
Attorney General of Virginia.
"These anti-bullying efforts may be paying off. According to the data, the number of bullying"
incidents had been relatively stable from 2006-2007 through 2008-2009. In the 2009-2010
"school year, which is the most recent data available, there were 1191 fewer incidents, or a"
"reduction of 18 percent, of bullying offenses reported to VDOE from the school divisions."
This also reflected 16 percent fewer individual student offenders being involved in reported
bullying offenses. The department is working closely with school divisions on this issue and
looks forward to seeing if this is an ongoing trend.
The Board of Education is developing Guidelines for the Prevention of Sexual Misconduct and Abuse
in Virginia Public Schools to help school divisions meet their obligation under the law and
create and implement policies and procedures that establish clear and reasonable boundaries
"for interactions between students and teachers, other school board employees, and adult"
volunteers. The model policies and best practices in the document draw from policies and
legislation approved by school boards and legislatures in other states and policies and best
practices implemented by private and parochial schools and national youth-service
organizations.
"On the student health front, the Board of Education worked with the state’s health care"
leaders and other interested stakeholders in conducting the research necessary for the
development of guidelines for concussions in student-athletes.
Compliance with the Requirements of the
Standards of Quality
Section 22.1-18 of the Code of Virginia requires the Board of Education to “identify any
school divisions and the specific schools therein which have failed to establish and maintain
schools meeting the existing prescribed standards of quality.”
Ninety-four divisions reported full compliance with the provisions of the Standards of
Quality (SOQ) in the 2009-2010 school year. Appendix B contains a list of school divisions
that have reported non-compliance with any of the provisions of the SOQ. The appendix
also provides additional information on the status of compliance over the last three years for
"these divisions. Students in 1,814 of the Commonwealth’s 1,850 schools met or exceeded"
