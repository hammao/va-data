•,Seeking new and efficient ways to use technology to reduce the testing burden on
,"teachers and students, but to do so in a way that will not reduce accountability"
,standards and that can be accomplished with available funding.
•,Dealing effectively with the realities of schooling for some children who face
,"difficult personal circumstances such as high poverty, high crime in their"
,"neighborhoods, high rates of unhealthy behaviors, poor nutrition, and other"
,circumstances that obstruct their learning at school. This includes the need for the
,Board’s continued advocacy for programs that keep children safe and teach positive
,"behavior, such as anti-bullying programs."
•,Finding new and effective ways to partner with colleges and universities and school
,"divisions in the preparation, recruitment, and retention of highly qualified teachers"
,and other educational personnel. A corollary to this is the need for concerted effort
,to develop and promote policies to help divisions recruit and maintain minority
,teachers and educational personnel.
•,Finding and promoting new and effective ways to involve parents in their child’s
,"education, a critical need that must be addressed if Virginia is to promote safe and"
,healthy school environments and eliminate achievement gaps.
•,"Helping teachers and administrators at all levels to gather, analyze, and use data to"
,continuously improve teaching and learning—the data analysis work that can lead
,their schools to understand what needs to change to get better results. A further
,challenge is to create new resources for professional development that put usable
,information into the hands of those directly responsible for students’ learning.
