The Board shall review annually the accreditation status of all schools in the Commonwealth.
Each local school board shall maintain schools that are fully accredited pursuant to the standards for accreditation as
prescribed by the Board of Education. Each local school board shall review the accreditation status of all schools in the local
"school division annually in public session. Within the time specified by the Board of Education, each school board shall"
submit corrective action plans for any schools within its school division that have been designated as not meeting the
standards as approved by the Board.
When the Board of Education has obtained evidence through the school academic review process that the failure of schools
"within a division to achieve full accreditation status is related to division level failure to implement the Standards of Quality,"
the Board may require a division level academic review. After the conduct of such review and within the time specified by the
"Board of Education, each school board shall submit for approval by the Board a corrective action plan, consistent with criteria"
established by the Board and setting forth specific actions and a schedule designed to ensure that schools within its school
division achieve full accreditation status. Such corrective action plans shall be part of the relevant school division's
comprehensive plan pursuant to § 22.1-253.13:6.
"With such funds as are appropriated or otherwise received for this purpose, the Board shall adopt and implement an"
"academic review process, to be conducted by the Department of Education, to assist schools that are accredited with"
"warning. The Department shall forward a report of each academic review to the relevant local school board, and such school"
board shall report the results of such academic review and the required annual progress reports in public session. The local
school board shall implement any actions identified through the academic review and utilize them for improvement planning.
B. The Superintendent of Public Instruction shall develop and the Board of Education shall approve criteria for determining
"and recognizing educational performance in the Commonwealth's public school divisions and schools. Such criteria, when"
"approved, shall become an integral part of the accreditation process and shall include student outcome measurements. The"
Superintendent of Public Instruction shall annually identify to the Board those school divisions and schools that exceed or do
not meet the approved criteria. Such identification shall include an analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of public
education programs in the various school divisions in Virginia and recommendations to the General Assembly for further
enhancing student learning uniformly across the Commonwealth. In recognizing educational performance in the school
"divisions, the Board shall include consideration of special school division accomplishments, such as numbers of dual"
"enrollments and students in Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate courses, and participation in academic"
year Governor's Schools.
The Superintendent of Public Instruction shall assist local school boards in the implementation of action plans for increasing
educational performance in those school divisions and schools that are identified as not meeting the approved criteria. The
Superintendent of Public Instruction shall monitor the implementation of and report to the Board of Education on the
effectiveness of the corrective actions taken to improve the educational performance in such school divisions and schools.
"C. With such funds as are available for this purpose, the Board of Education shall prescribe assessment methods to"
determine the level of achievement of the Standards of Learning objectives by all students. Such assessments shall evaluate
"knowledge, application of knowledge, critical thinking, and skills related to the Standards of Learning being assessed. The"
"Board shall (i) in consultation with the chairpersons of the eight regional superintendents' study groups, establish a timetable"
for administering the Standards of Learning assessments to ensure genuine end-of-course and end-of-grade testing and (ii)
"with the assistance of independent testing experts, conduct a regular analysis and validation process for these assessments."
"In prescribing such Standards of Learning assessments, the Board shall provide local school boards the option of"
"administering tests for United States History to 1877, United States History: 1877 to the Present, and Civics and Economics."
The last administration of the cumulative grade eight history test will be during the 2007-2008 academic school year.
"Beginning with the 2008-2009 academic year, all school divisions shall administer the United States History to 1877, United"
"States History: 1877 to the Present, and Civics and Economics tests. The Board shall also provide the option of industry"
certification and state licensure examinations as a student-selected verified credit.
The Board of Education shall make publicly available such assessments in a timely manner and as soon as practicable
"following the administration of such tests, so long as the release of such assessments does not compromise test security or"
