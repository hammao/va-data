Objective 1: The Board of Education will continue to
enhance the quality standards for all public schools in
Virginia.
"From 2008 to 2010, the Board adopted revised Standards of Learning (SOL) in mathematics,"
"English, science, and history and social science. During the revisions of the mathematics"
"and English standards in particular, there was a substantial effort made to work with outside"
"experts to establish Standards of Learning that, if mastered, would prepare students for"
success in college and careers. The mathematics and English standards reflect the
substantial input and recommended changes provided by college faculty and other experts
"from the College Board, ACT, the American Diploma Project, and the business community."
These groups support Virginia’s revisions and have validated the standards as college and
career ready.
"With the Board’s adoption of these revised standards, the Virginia Department of Education"
(VDOE) is developing new tests that will measure students’ mastery of the more rigorous
content standards. The new mathematics and English assessments will be administered
"online, and include technology-enhanced items that require students to demonstrate content"
mastery in ways that were not possible with multiple-choice tests. The result of the
"standards revision, therefore, will be that students will have to demonstrate mastery of more"
rigorous content in mathematics and English in order to pass the revised SOL tests.
"In addition to the standards revisions, VDOE is developing the new tests to enable the"
Board to establish college ready achievement levels on certain end-of-course assessments in
English and mathematics.. The college ready achievement level will replace advanced
proficiency on certain end-of-course tests. The addition of a college ready cut score on
certain end-of-course mathematics and English assessments is part of the Virginia College
and Career Readiness Initiative.
Highlights: Actions To meet Objective 1
"The Board of Education regularly reviews and revises the Standards of Quality (SOQ),"
"Standards of Accreditation (SOA), and Standards of Learning (SOL). Throughout this"
"process, the Board collects data and information that support its ability to thoughtfully and"
deliberately make revisions that are designed to enhance the quality of the standards to
which Virginia’s students are held.
"In 2010, the Board adopted revised Standards of Learning for English and Science, along"
with revised curriculum frameworks for these core subjects. The Board also adopted the
curriculum framework for its Economics and Personal Finance Standards of Learning.
"In June 2010, the Board of Education reaffirmed its intention that the academic standards"
for Virginia’s schools shall be second to none. Much has been made in media reports about
the Common Core State Standards. The Board of Education is committed to the Virginia
Standards of Learning program and opposed a word-for-word adoption of the newly
developed Common Core State Standards as a prerequisite for participation in federal
competitive grant and entitlement programs.
