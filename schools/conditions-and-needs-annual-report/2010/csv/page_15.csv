"in science achievement, eight countries had more eighth-grade students earning proficient"

Ensuring Virginia’s Academic Standards Lead the Nation in Rigor and Quality
The Board of Education has taken an aggressive stand to ensure that the Standards of
Learning program is tightly aligned with the national expectations for student achievement.
"In 2010, the National Governors Association (NGA) and the Council of Chief State School"
Officers (CCSSO) released the Mathematics Common Core State Standards. Virginia’s 2009
Mathematics Standards of Learning and Mathematics Curriculum Framework have a strong
"alignment to the Mathematics Common Core State Standards. In fact, the Board took action"
in November 2010 and adopted supplement to the curriculum framework for the Mathematics
Standards of Learning. The supplement completes and strengthens the content to equal or
exceed the content and rigor of the Mathematics Common Core State Standards.
"In addition to the intense focus on the mathematics standards, the Board revised the"
Curriculum Framework for the English Standards of Learning. The revised framework contains
"content that was recommended by Achieve, The College Board, and ACT as a result of"
comparison studies of Virginia’s standards with their respective standards and benchmarks
"for postsecondary readiness. Additionally, the revised curriculum framework contains"
"content from the English/Language Arts Common Core State Standards. Thus, Virginia’s"
standards meet or exceed national standards in English as well as in mathematics.
Funding the Standards of Quality (SOQ)
There can be no doubt that a challenging year is ahead as Virginia’s public schools face the
economic headwinds that have developed in recent months. The difficult fiscal situation will
"be exacerbated if the flow of federal stimulus funds ends, as expected. In Virginia, Direct"
Aid to localities for public education is the single largest General Fund expenditure. The
current fiscal climate at the state and federal levels challenges the stability of public
"education, social services, and other supports for children and families. Resources are"
limited for students who require extra help or special attention. The challenge requires that
fiscal and human resources be focused on the instruction students receive in the classroom
and on making sure every student is successful.
Assisting Chronically Low-Performing Schools
What to do about chronically low-performing schools is a central issue in the Board of
Education’s school improvement efforts and accountability system. Its urgency is
"underscored by the federal Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), which"
mandates an aggressive system of corrective measures for schools receiving federal
assistance that fail to meet progress goals.
It is anticipated that more schools will struggle to meet full accreditation because of difficulty
in meeting the aggressive objective for graduation rates and other key measures set by the
"Board of Education. As the Board moves to increase the rigor for full accreditation,"
