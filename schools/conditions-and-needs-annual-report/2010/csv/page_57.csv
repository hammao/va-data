"F. To assess the educational progress of students as individuals and as groups, each local school board shall require the use"

"examinations, to evaluate student progress and to determine educational performance. Each local school shall require the"
"administration of appropriate assessments to all students for grade levels and courses identified by the Board of Education,"
"which may include criterion-referenced tests, teacher-made tests and alternative assessment instruments and shall include"
the Standards of Learning Assessments and the National Assessment of Educational Progress state-by-state assessment.
"Each school board shall analyze and report annually, in compliance with any criteria that may be established by the Board of"
"Education, the results from the Stanford Achievement Test Series, Ninth Edition (Stanford Nine) assessment, if administered,"
"industry certification examinations, and the Standards of Learning Assessments to the public."
"The Board of Education shall not require administration of the Stanford Achievement Test Series, Ninth Edition (Stanford"
"Nine) assessment, except as may be selected to facilitate compliance with the requirements for home instruction pursuant to"
§ 22.1-254.1.
The Board shall include requirements for the reporting of the Standards of Learning assessment scores and averages for
each year as part of the Board's requirements relating to the School Performance Report Card. Such scores shall be
disaggregated for each school by student subgroups on the Virginia assessment program as appropriate and shall be
reported to the public within three months of their receipt. These reports (i) shall be posted on the portion of the Department
"of Education's website relating to the School Performance Report Card, in a format and in a manner that allows year-to-year"
"comparisons, and (ii) may include the National Assessment of Educational Progress state-by-state assessment."
G. Each local school division superintendent shall regularly review the division's submission of data and reports required by
state and federal law and regulations to ensure that all information is accurate and submitted in a timely fashion. The

"prescribed tests, and meet such other requirements as may be prescribed by the local school board and approved by the"
Board of Education. Provisions shall be made to facilitate the transfer and appropriate grade placement of students from
"other public secondary schools, from nonpublic schools, or from home instruction as outlined in the standards for"
accreditation. Course credits earned for online courses taken in the Department of Education's Virtual Virginia program shall
"transfer to Virginia public schools in accordance with provisions of the standards for accreditation. Further, reasonable"
accommodation to meet the requirements for diplomas shall be provided for otherwise qualified students with disabilities as
needed.
"In addition, each local school board may devise, vis-a-vis the award of diplomas to secondary school students, a mechanism"
for calculating class rankings that takes into consideration whether the student has taken a required class more than one time
and has had any prior earned grade for such required class expunged.
Each local school board shall notify the parents of rising eleventh and twelfth grade students of (i) the number and subject
area requirements of standard and verified units of credit required for graduation pursuant to the standards for accreditation
and (ii) the remaining number and subject area requirements of such units of credit the individual student requires for
