Dear Governor McDonnell and Members of the Virginia General Assembly:
"On behalf of the Board of Education, I am pleased to transmit the 2010 Annual Report on the"
"Condition and Needs of Public Schools in Virginia, submitted pursuant to § 22.1-18 of the Code of"
"Virginia. The report contains information on Virginia’s public schools, including an analysis"
of student academic performance and a report on the school divisions’ compliance with the
requirements of the Standards of Quality and the Standards of Accreditation.
Increasing academic achievement for all students is the core of the Board of Education’s
mission. This means that every student is expected to graduate from high school prepared
to move on to productive work and further study. This report contains compelling evidence
that our schools and our students are achieving at higher levels. The progress shown by our
"public schools is the result of ongoing collaboration, dedication, workable strategies, and"
"wise use of resources, both human and financial. It is the result of the hard work of"
"students, teachers, administrators, support staff, parents, and supporters throughout the"
Commonwealth.
"The report also points to evidence that persistent challenges remain to be tackled, and there"
is a challenging year ahead as the state and localities face the economic headwinds that have
developed in recent months.
The Board of Education is grateful for the continued support that the Governor and
"General Assembly give to Virginia’s school improvement efforts. As we look to the future,"
the members of the Board of Education pledge to remain focused on providing the best
educational opportunities and the brightest future for the young people enrolled in Virginia’s
public schools.
"Sincerely,"
Eleanor B. Saslaw
President
