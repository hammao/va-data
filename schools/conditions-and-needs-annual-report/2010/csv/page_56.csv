"deplete the bank of assessment questions necessary to construct subsequent tests, or limit the ability to test students on"
demand and provide immediate results in the web-based assessment system.
The Board shall include in the student outcome measures that are required by the Standards for Accreditation end-of-course
"or end-of-grade tests for various grade levels and classes, as determined by the Board, in accordance with the Standards of"
"Learning. These Standards of Learning assessments shall include, but need not be limited to, end-of-course or end-of-grade"
"tests for English, mathematics, science, and history and social science."
"In addition, to assess the educational progress of students, the Board of Education shall (i) develop appropriate"
"assessments, which may include criterion-referenced tests and alternative assessment instruments that may be used by"
classroom teachers; (ii) select appropriate industry certification and state licensure examinations and (iii) prescribe and
"provide measures, which may include nationally normed tests to be used to identify students who score in the bottom quartile"
at selected grade levels. An annual justification that includes evidence that the student meets the participation criteria defined
by the Virginia Department of Education shall be provided for each student considered for the Virginia Grade Level
Alternative. Each Individual Education Program team shall review such justification and make the final determination as to
whether or not the Virginia Grade Level Alternative is appropriate for the student. The superintendent and the school board
"chairman shall certify to the Board of Education, as a part of certifying compliance with the Standards of Quality, that there is"
a justification in the Individual Education Program for every student who takes the Virginia Grade Level Alternative.
Compliance with this requirement shall be monitored as a part of the special education monitoring process conducted by the
Department of Education. The Board shall report to the Governor and General Assembly in its annual reports pursuant to §
22.1-18 any school division that is not in compliance with this requirement.
"The Standard of Learning requirements, including all related assessments, shall be waived for any student awarded a"
"scholarship under the Brown v. Board of Education Scholarship Program, pursuant to § 30-231.2, who is enrolled in a"
preparation program for the General Education Development (GED) certificate or in an adult basic education program to
obtain the high school diploma.
The Board of Education may adopt special provisions related to the administration and use of any SOL test or tests in a
content area as applied to accreditation ratings for any period during which the SOL content or assessments in that area are
"being revised and phased in. Prior to statewide administration of such tests, the Board of Education shall provide notice to"
local school boards regarding such special provisions.
D. The Board of Education may pursue all available civil remedies pursuant to § 22.1-19.1 or administrative action pursuant
to § 22.1-292.1 for breaches in test security and unauthorized alteration of test materials or test results.
"The Board may initiate or cause to be initiated a review or investigation of any alleged breach in security, unauthorized"
"alteration, or improper administration of tests by local school board employees responsible for the distribution or"
administration of the tests.
Records and other information furnished to or prepared by the Board during the conduct of a review or investigation may be
"withheld pursuant to subdivision 12 of § 2.2-3705.3. However, this section shall not prohibit the disclosure of records to (i) a"
local school board or division superintendent for the purpose of permitting such board or superintendent to consider or to take
"personnel action with regard to an employee or (ii) any requester, after the conclusion of a review or investigation, in a form"
that (a) does not reveal the identity of any person making a complaint or supplying information to the Board on a confidential
basis and (b) does not compromise the security of any test mandated by the Board. Any local school board or division
"superintendent receiving such records or other information shall, upon taking personnel action against a relevant employee,"
place copies of such records or information relating to the specific employee in such person's personnel file.
"Notwithstanding any other provision of state law, no test or examination authorized by this section, including the Standards of"
"Learning assessments, shall be released or required to be released as minimum competency tests, if, in the judgment of the"
"Board, such release would breach the security of such test or examination or deplete the bank of questions necessary to"
construct future secure tests.
