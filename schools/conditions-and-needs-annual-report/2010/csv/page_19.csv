New Initiatives for 2010
The Board of Education is firmly committed to providing leadership to help schools and
divisions meet higher standards for all students. Legislation proposed by Governor Robert
F. McDonnell and approved by the 2010 General Assembly creates additional opportunities
for students to learn and gives the Board of Education responsibility to implement the
provisions of the new programs.
"New Initiatives: Charter Schools, College Partnership Laboratory Schools, and"
Online Providers
"As a springboard for action, the President of the Board of Education, Mrs. Eleanor B."
"Saslaw, established two new committees to focus attention on priorities for action: the"
Charter School Committee and the College Partnership Laboratory School Committee. The
"committees consist of members of the Board, and the chairs of the respective committees"
have set an agenda for action that will move the Board closer to meeting its goal of
"expanding learning opportunities for all students. Also, the Board has supported the work"
related to two new initiatives undertaken by the Virginia Department of Education that
directly relate to the priorities of the Board.
Charter School Committee:
Charter schools provide options for parents and students while allowing communities and
educators to create innovative instructional programs that can be replicated elsewhere in the
public school system. All charter schools in Virginia are nonsectarian alternative public
schools located within a school division and under the authority of a local school board. To
"carry out its responsibilities, the Board’s Charter School Committee was formed and set to"
work immediately to develop or revise the following: procedures for receiving and reviewing
charter school applications; criteria used in reviewing applications; a listing of regulations
that may be waived for charter schools; and criteria for making distributions from the charter
"school fund. During its deliberations, the committee held informative discussions with a"
"panel of national experts, followed by panels of leaders of statewide organizations. It is"
"anticipated that the procedures, criteria, and regulations will be adopted by the Board at the"
January 2011 meeting.
College Partnership Laboratory School Committee:
College partnership laboratory schools are public schools established by contract between
the governing board of a college or university and the Board of Education. The 2010
legislation allows any public institution of higher education in the Commonwealth with an
approved teacher-preparation program to establish a college partnership laboratory school.
The Board’s College Partnership Laboratory School Committee was established and is in the
process of developing the following: procedures for receiving college partnership laboratory
school applications; an application and criteria used in reviewing applications; a listing of
regulations that may be waived; and criteria for making distributions from the college
partnership laboratory fund.
