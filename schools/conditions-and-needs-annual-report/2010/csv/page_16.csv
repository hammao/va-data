Education to assist divisions previously identified as low-performing may become
"increasingly difficult, especially in this time of agency budget and staffing restrictions."
Providing Programs to Narrow Persistent Achievement Gaps
This is one of the most pressing challenges that states across this nation face. Virginia is no
exception. Gaps in graduation rates exist between Virginia’s black and Hispanic students and
their white and Asian counterparts. This is equally true for students who are economically
"disadvantaged. Although improving, gaps also persist on the statewide assessments among"
Virginia’s black and Hispanic students and their white and Asian counterparts. Recent
"changes in federal education policy have put the spotlight on the achievement gap issue, and"
schools are struggling to bring all students’ achievement up to high levels.
"The good news is Virginia is making progress. For example, Virginia has one of the nation's"
"smallest achievement gaps between whites and Hispanics. Here, eighth-grade Hispanic"
students had the highest NAEP writing scores for Hispanic students in any state. The
persistent challenge is to accelerate this progress and raise the achievement of all students.
Implementing New Learning Opportunities for Students
The Board of Education is putting in place new policies and guidelines for initiatives that
expand learning opportunities for all children. These policies relate to high-quality charter
"schools, college partnership laboratory schools, and online learning programs. This also"
"includes science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education programs."
The Board’s challenge is to ensure that its policies and the manner in which they are
"implemented are student-centered, effective, cost-efficient, and practical."
Dealing with Increasingly Burdensome Federal Reporting Requirements
At a time in which the Virginia Department of Education is actively seeking ways to cut
"reporting requirements on local divisions, the department must itself keep up with"
increasingly burdensome and time-consuming federal reporting and accountability
"requirements, especially those related to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act"
"(previously known as No Child Left Behind), the Individuals with Disabilities Education"
"Act, and the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund."
Promoting High-Quality Preschool Programs
The number of school divisions participating in the Virginia Preschool Initiative has grown
"from 75 in the 2001-2002 school year, to 114 in the 2008-2009 school year. Also, the"
"number of children served has grown from 5,966 in 2001-2002 to 15,900 children in 2010."
"Despite this growth, the number of at-risk four-year-olds in Virginia continues to be a"
"concern. Without providing high quality preschool to all at-risk four-year-olds, many at-risk"
five-year-old children will continue to enter kindergarten without adequate preparation to be
fully ready to learn.
