The committee began its work by convening a panel of nationally recognized experts in the
"college laboratory field, followed by discussions with Virginia college and university"
"provosts, deans, and directors of teacher education programs. Final recommendations on"
procedures and criteria will be made by the Board at the January 2011 meeting.
Multidivision Online Providers:
"Also new in legislation for 2010, the Superintendent of Public Instruction is required to"
"develop, and the Board is required to approve, criteria for approving and monitoring"
multidivision online providers of virtual school programs. It allows local school boards to
enter into contracts with approved multidivision online providers to deliver virtual
programs.
"""Multidivision online provider"" means (i) a private or nonprofit organization that enters into"
a contract with a local school board to provide online courses or programs through that
school board to students who reside in Virginia both within and outside the geographical
boundaries of that school division; (ii) a private or nonprofit organization that enters into
contracts with multiple local school boards to provide online courses or programs to
students in grades K through 12 through those school boards; or (iii) a local school board
that provides online courses or programs to students who reside in Virginia but outside the
geographical boundaries of that school division.
"The Superintendent must develop model policies for school divisions, and the Board must"
submit information about virtual school programs in its annual report to the Governor and
"to the General Assembly, beginning in November 2011. In October 2010, the Board"
approved the first set of multidivision online providers and will report on these providers
and any subsequent additions in its annual report for 2011.
Support for Virginia Department of Education Initiatives
College and Career Readiness Initiative:
"Being developed and implemented by the Virginia Department of Education (VDOE), the"
Virginia College and Career Readiness Initiative (CCRI) builds on the revised Standards of
"Learning in mathematics and English adopted in 2009 and 2010, respectively. The revised"
standards reflect the substantial input and recommended changes provided by college faculty
"and other experts from the College Board, ACT, the American Diploma Project, and the"
business community. These groups support Virginia’s revisions and have validated the
standards as college and career ready. The Virginia College and Career Readiness Initiative
builds on the revised standards and is designed to:
"(1) Ensure that college and career ready learning standards in reading, writing, and"
mathematics are taught in every Virginia high school classroom; and
(2) Strengthen students’ preparation for college and the work force before leaving high
school.
