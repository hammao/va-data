B. Students identified as disabled who complete the requirements of their individualized education programs shall be
awarded special diplomas by local school boards.
Each local school board shall notify the parent of such students with disabilities who have an individualized education
program and who fail to meet the requirements for a standard or advanced studies diploma of the student's right to a free and
"appropriate education to age 21, inclusive, pursuant to Article 2 (§ 22.1-213 et seq.) of Chapter 13 of this title."
C. Students who have completed a prescribed course of study as defined by the local school board shall be awarded
"certificates of program completion by local school boards if they are not eligible to receive a standard, advanced studies,"
"modified standard, special, or general achievement diploma."
Each local school board shall provide notification of the right to a free public education for students who have not reached 20
"years of age on or before August 1 of the school year, pursuant to Chapter 1 (§ 22.1-1 et seq.) of this title, to the parent of"
students who fail to graduate or who have failed to achieve the number of verified units of credit required for graduation as
provided in the standards for accreditation. If such student who does not graduate or achieve such verified units of credit is a
"student for whom English is a second language, the local school board shall notify the parent of the student's opportunity for"
a free public education in accordance with § 22.1-5.
"D. In establishing course and credit requirements for a high school diploma, the Board shall:"
1. Provide for the selection of integrated learning courses meeting the Standards of Learning and approved by the Board to
"satisfy graduation credit requirements, which shall include Standards of Learning testing, as necessary."
"2. Establish the requirements for a standard, modified standard, or advanced studies high school diploma, which shall include"
one credit in fine or performing arts or career and technical education and one credit in United States and Virginia history.
"The requirements for a standard high school diploma shall, however, include at least two sequential electives chosen from a"
concentration of courses selected from a variety of options that may be planned to ensure the completion of a focused
sequence of elective courses. Students may take such focused sequence of elective courses in consecutive years or any two
years of high school. Such focused sequence of elective courses shall provide a foundation for further education or training or
"preparation for employment, shall be identified in the Academic and Career Plan as described in Board of Education"
"regulations, and shall be developed by the school division, consistent with Board of Education guidelines and as approved by"
the local school board.
3. Establish the requirements for a technical diploma. This diploma shall meet or exceed the requirements of a standard
"diploma and will include a concentration in career and technical education, as established in Board regulations. A student"
who meets the requirement for the advanced studies diploma who also fulfills a concentration in career and technical
"education shall receive an advanced technical diploma, or if he chooses, he shall receive an advanced studies diploma. The"
Board may develop or designate assessments in career and technical education for the purposes of awarding verified credit
pursuant to subdivision 6.
"4. Provide, in the requirements for the verified units of credit stipulated for obtaining the standard or advanced studies"
"diploma, that students completing elective classes into which the Standards of Learning for any required course have been"
"integrated may take the relevant Standards of Learning test for the relevant required course and receive, upon achieving a"
"satisfactory score on the specific Standards of Learning assessment, a verified unit of credit for such elective class that shall"
be deemed to satisfy the Board's requirement for verified credit for the required course.
"5. Establish a procedure to facilitate the acceleration of students that allows qualified students, with the recommendation of"
"the division superintendent, without completing the 140-hour class, to obtain credit for such class upon demonstration of"
"mastery of the course content and objectives. Having received credit for the course, the student shall be permitted to sit for"
"the relevant Standards of Learning assessment and, upon receiving a passing score, shall earn a verified credit. Nothing in"
this section shall preclude relevant school division personnel from enforcing compulsory attendance in public schools.
"6. Provide for the award of verified units of credit for passing scores on industry certifications, state licensure examinations,"
and national occupational competency assessments approved by the Board of Education.
