The findings so far of the College and Career Readiness Initiative show the indicators of
"college readiness. In short, students who meet the following indicators are likely to enroll in"
"college, and upon enrollment, be permitted to enter directly into entry-level, credit-bearing"
courses in college:
(1) Earned an advanced studies diploma
(2) Earned advanced proficient scores on the English reading and writing assessments;
"(3) Achieved advanced proficient on the Algebra I assessment, participated in Algebra"
"II, and near advanced proficient or above on the Algebra II SOL assessment."
(4) Participated in chemistry.
"In addition, participating in Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, and dual"
enrollment courses in high school further reduces the likelihood that students will be placed
in developmental coursework in college.
Study and Development of Model Teacher and Administrator Evaluation Systems: The
Board of Education has received updates on the Virginia Department of Education’s
comprehensive study of teacher and administrator evaluation. This study is designed to:
(1) Provide models that may be used by school divisions to develop differentiated or
performance-based compensation systems; and
(2) Provide revised guidance documents and new evaluation models for teachers that
can be used in school divisions to improve student achievement by improving
"teacher performance, increasing teacher retention, and developing meaningful,"
targeted professional development.
The study will target divisions with high-poverty schools and persistently low-performing
schools as initial pilot sites for revised evaluation models. The department plans to complete
the Guidance documents and evaluation models in December 2010 and present the
documents to the Board of Education in January and February 2011.
