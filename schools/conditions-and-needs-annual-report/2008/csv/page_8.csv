Objective 7: The Board of Education will provide leadership in implementing the provisions of state and
federal laws and regulations.
Objective 8: The Board of Education will provide leadership to help schools and school divisions
ensure a safe and secure environment conducive to facilitating the teaching and learning process.
Critical Areas of Need: The Board’s objectives—and the performance measures used to gauge our
progress in meeting those objectives—focus on the most critical needs of the public schools. These
needs include the following:
"Funding the Standards of Quality (SOQ): In November 2008, the Board of Education adopted a"
resolution that acknowledges the economic conditions facing the Commonwealth in the next year.
The resolution also acknowledges the challenges that are before the Governor and the General
Assembly to deal with budget constraints while protecting core services in the area of Pk-12
"education. In the resolution, the Board stated its SOQ priorities to the Governor and the General"
"Assembly for their consideration in the 2009 General Assembly Session. Moreover, the Board"
affirmed its support for those provisions of the Standards of Quality that have been recommended
"by the Board in recent years and that are yet to be adopted and funded, and the Board stated its"
intent to request approval and full funding of these staffing requirements beginning in the next
biennium.
"Further, the resolution outlines the Board’s requests for approval during the 2009 Session of the"
General Assembly in the form of “intermediate SOQ implementation options” that would enable
"school divisions to use existing SOQ and incentive program funding to hire data coordinators,"
"reading specialists, mathematics teacher specialists, and English Language Learner (ELL) teachers to"
provide additional support in classrooms. A description of the four SOQ options is contained in the
body of the annual report.
A Persistent Achievement Gap: Virginia is making progress in eliminating achievement gaps among
"groups of students. Nonetheless, in one-quarter of Virginia’s schools, pass rates for economically"
disadvantaged students are more than 10 percent lower than for all students in the same schools; in
"more than half of our schools, pass rates for economically disadvantaged students are more than 5"
"percentage points lower than the pass rate for all students. Furthermore, Black and Hispanic"
students have pass rates that are more than 10 percent lower than for all students in 18 and 43
"percent of schools, respectively."
"Compounding the problem, economically disadvantaged students and minority students are less"
"likely than all students to graduate in four years. There is a 9-, 11-, and 12- point achievement gap"
"for Black, Hispanic, and economically disadvantaged students, respectively, compared to the overall"
graduation rate.
Safe and Healthy Environments for Students and Teachers: A high priority for the Board is dealing
effectively with the realities of schooling for some children who face difficult personal circumstances
"such as high poverty, high crime in their neighborhoods, high rates of unhealthy behaviors, poor"
"nutrition, and other circumstances that obstruct their learning at school. The Board of Education"
"must help local divisions by providing solid, workable guidelines and policies to assist those who are"
