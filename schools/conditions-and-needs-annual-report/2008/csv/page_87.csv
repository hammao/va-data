"categories noted above for every school division and averages the costs, using a weighting"
system that recognizes and adjusts for reported costs that are unusually high or unusually low.
The product of the formula becomes the funding standard viewed as the prevailing support cost.
Prevailing support costs are included in Basic Aid. Both positions and non-salary support are
funded through this process.
This formula resulted from the review by the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission
(JLARC) in the 1980s.
OTHER SOQ FUNDED ITEMS:
SALES TAX: This funding component is not specifically identified in the Standards of Quality.
"However, the 1974 General Assembly, when it established the framework for the Standards of"
"Quality, included sales tax as one of four key funding elements. Sales tax distributed to school"
divisions represents the portion of net revenue from the state sales and use tax dedicated to
"public education (1 1/8%) that is distributed to counties, cities, and towns in support of the"
Standards of Quality.
Distribution is based upon each locality's pro-rata share of school age population as based on a
triennial school census. The formula works as follows: Triennial census count by school division
divided by the total triennial census count for the state multiplied by the estimate of the share of
state sales tax dedicated to public education (1 1/8%).
TEXTBOOKS: This funding component is not specifically identified in the Standards of Quality.
The practice of including textbooks in the Standards of Quality has been longstanding because of
the link to instructional services and because state law mandates that textbooks required for
instruction be provided free of charge.
State funding is provided on a per pupil basis based on the statewide prevailing per pupil cost of
textbooks incurred by school divisions. The formula works as follows: uniform statewide per pupil
amount multiplied by average daily membership to produce a total cost. This total cost is then
adjusted by the composite index of local ability-to-pay to yield the state and local shares.
FRINGE BENEFITS: This funding component is not specifically identified in the Standards of
"Quality. The practice of including fringe benefit costs (retirement, Social Security, group life,"
health care) has been longstanding because of the link to funding the salary/benefit cost of
instructional positions.
A unique per pupil amount per division is produced using actual cost data provided by the school
division. This per pupil amount is then multiplied by division-level average daily membership and
then adjusted for the composite index of local ability-to-pay to yield the state and local shares.
