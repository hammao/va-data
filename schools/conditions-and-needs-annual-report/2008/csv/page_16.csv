"During 2008, the Mathematics Standards of Learning are undergoing revision. In support of the"
"revisions, the outside groups—The College Board, ACT, and Achieve (through the American"
Diploma Project)—analyzed the alignment of Virginia’s Mathematics Standards of Learning with college
and workplace readiness benchmarks. This work has informed the review process and will increase
"the quality of Virginia’s mathematics standards. Also, the Board recently adopted revised Standards"
of Learning for the following subjects:
History and Social Science;
Physical Education;
Health Education; and
Driver Education.
"In addition, the Board adopted revised curriculum frameworks for History and Social Sciences and"
"for Algebra, Functions, and Data Analysis. The Board also adopted the World Class Instructional"
"Design Assessment ELP Standards of Learning, a move widely considered beneficial to local divisions"
and essential to keep Virginia’s standards consistent with best practice in the field.
"Virginia received a $500,000 grant from the National Governors Association (NGA) Center for Best"
"Practices to improve science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. The"
Board has been involved in two major activities under the grant: 1) the development of Governor’s
Career and Technical Academies and 2) the creation of the Governor’s Career and Technical
Education Exemplary Standards Awards Program. The Board of Education approved the Standards
for the Governor’s CTE Exemplary Awards Program in March 2008. The Board also approved the
criteria to establish a Governor’s Career and Technical Academy and approved the establishment of
the first Academies during the spring of 2008.
Objective 2: The Board of Education will provide leadership to help schools and school
divisions eliminate the achievement gap between groups of students and increase the
academic success of all students.
"As More Students Meet Proficiency Goals,"
More are Achieving at the Advanced Level
"As pass rates for student subgroups increase statewide, more students pass the"
"assessments at the proficient and advanced levels in all content areas. That is, our schools"
"are not only helping more students meet minimal proficiency goals, but also helping more"
students achieve at advanced levels.
"Achievement Gaps Still Persist, But are Narrowing"
"For Standards of Learning assessments, achievement gaps have narrowed for both"
"reading and mathematics, and the gaps in science and history and social science continue"
to narrow for Black and Hispanic students compared to their White peers.
Virginia’s schools are making progress on the persistent problem of gaps among groups of students
in achievement on statewide assessments. Virginia’s eighth grade Hispanic students had the highest
