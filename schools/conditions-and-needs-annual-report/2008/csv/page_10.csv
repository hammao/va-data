A huge step forward to address this issue is the newly created Office of Early Childhood
Development is now coordinating state programs aimed at improving the lives and education of the
commonwealth’s youngest citizens and residents. The office represents an inter-agency approach to
"managing services for young children and their families, with the staff reporting to both the Virginia"
Department of Education and the Virginia Department of Social Services.
The Office of Early Childhood Development is responsible for coordinating services for children
"from birth to age 5, including the Virginia Preschool Initiative, Head Start, childcare subsidies,"
provider services and other state-level efforts to advance early childhood development and learning.
The office also will work through a liaison with the Virginia Department of Health to ensure the
integration of health-related programs.
Twenty-first Century Literacy Skills
"In 2007-2008, 87 percent of Virginia’s students passed the Standards of Learning English"
"assessments, compared to 85 percent in the previous year. Also, 84 percent of students passed the"
"statewide mathematics tests, up from 80 percent the previous year. Given the critical importance of"
"reading and mathematics for life success, it is critical that the Board continue to emphasize these"
skills. While more than 81 percent of the students in the class of 2008 graduated on time with a
"diploma, almost 20 percent of our students are not graduating on time with their class. We need to"
"know why that is, and we need to address the needs of these students so that everyone graduates"
successfully.
Virginia has a new initiative that will help parents select books that will strengthen their children’s
reading skills. When elementary and middle school students receive their Standards of Learning
"(SOL) test reports next spring and summer, their reading scores will be accompanied by a"
corresponding “Lexile measure” parents can use to select books. A Lexile measure ranks reading
"ability and text difficulty on a single scale, allowing parents — and teachers — to select books at or"
slightly above a student’s reading level.
Promoting Parental and Family Involvement
The family and the home are both critical education institutions where children begin learning long
"before they start school, and where they spend much of their time after they start school. It stands"
to reason that involving parents in their child’s education is conducive to learning. Such
"involvement is critical if we are to improve the educational achievement of Virginia’s students,"
"promote safe and healthy school environments, and eliminate achievement gaps. To do this, schools"
need to promote and enhance cooperative partnerships in which families are allies in the efforts of
teachers and schools.
