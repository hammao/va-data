"legislation recommended by the Board, it did not recommend funding for four of the Board’s"
proposals. These included one full-time
principal in each elementary school; one full-time assistant principal for each 400 students in
each school; reduction of the state-required speech language pathologist caseload from 68 to 60
"students; and one full-time reading specialist for each 1,000 students."
The 2004 Appropriation Act passed by the General Assembly changed the required number of
"full-time equivalent instructional positions for each 1,000 students identified as having limited"
"English proficiency from 10 to 17, but no changes were made in the SOQ to reflect this language."
"In 2004, the Board recommended that the language in the SOQ be changed to comport with the"
"Appropriation Act requirement. Specifically, the Board recommended that “state funding, pursuant"
"to the appropriation act, shall be provided to support 17 full-time equivalent instructional positions"
"for each 1,000 students identified as having limited English proficiency.” This change was"
enacted by the 2005 General Assembly through House Bill 1762 and Senate Bill 779. The bills
also clarified provisions regarding the
"five positions per 1,000 students in kindergarten through grade five who serve as elementary"
"resource teachers in art, music, and physical education and the two positions per 1,000 students"
"in grades kindergarten through 12, one to provide technology support and one to serve as an"
"instructional technology resource teacher to be full-time equivalent positions. However, the 2005"
General Assembly did not appropriate the funding for the four unfunded positions that had been
proposed.
"In 2006, the Board began considering further changes to the Standards of Quality. On May 23,"
"2006, the Standards of Quality Committee of the Board of Education held a forum to hear"
comments from various organizations on potential changes to the Standards of Quality. Groups
"invited included the: Virginia Association of School Superintendents, Virginia School Boards"
Association and the Virginia School Board
"Association Limited English Proficiency Caucus, Virginia Education Association, Virginia"
"Association of Elementary School Principals, Virginia Association of Secondary School Principals,"
"Virginia Association of Supervision and Curriculum Development, Virginia Municipal League and"
Virginia Congress of Parents and Teachers.
"Additionally, between September 11 and September 27, 2006, the Board held ten public hearings"
"through Virginia and heard from 123 speakers. Following the forum and public hearings, the"
Board made the following staffing recommendations:
• Require one full-time principal in each elementary school. [The SOQ currently requires a half-
time principal for elementary schools with fewer than 300 students.]
• Require one full-time assistant principal for each 600 students in each school. [The SOQ
currently requires one half-time assistant principal at an elementary school with between 600 and
899 students and one full-time assistant principal at an elementary school with 900 or more
students. The current middle and secondary assistant principal standard in the SOQ is for one
full-time assistant principal per 600 students in a school.]
"• Require one full-time equivalent instructional position for each 1,000 students in average daily"
membership to serve as reading specialists for the school division.
• Require school boards to employ enough speech-language pathologists to ensure a caseload
that does not exceed 60 students per position.
"• Require one full-time equivalent instructional position for each 1,000 students in grades"
kindergarten through eight to serve as a mathematics specialist.
