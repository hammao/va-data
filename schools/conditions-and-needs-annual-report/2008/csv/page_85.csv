ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS: In addition to the positions supported by basic aid and
"those in support of regular school year programs of prevention, intervention, and remediation,"
"state funding, pursuant to the appropriation act, shall be provided to support 17 full-time"
"equivalent instructional positions for each 1,000 students identified as having limited English"
proficiency.
"The funding formula is as follows: 17 teachers per 1,000 English Language Learners multiplied by"
an average salary and fringe benefits. The product is adjusted by the composite index of local
ability-to-pay to determine state and local shares.
Increased accountability for LEP students as a result of the federal No Child Left Behind Act of
2001 require additional teacher resources to ensure that LEP students make annual gains in
developing English language proficiency and achieve success with the Standards of Learning.
States are required to report annual increases in the number or percentage of children attaining
English language proficiency as determined by an assessment of English language development
as well as the number of LEP students meeting adequate yearly progress on the SOL
assessments in English language and mathematics.
Information collected over the last year by the department has indicated that Virginia is one of a
handful of states with a defined staffing formula for English language learners.

The SOQ currently requires a half-time principal for elementary schools with fewer than 300
students. The responsibilities of the principal are demanding and present significant challenges
