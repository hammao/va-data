Virginia Preschool Initiative: Number of Children Enrolled is Increasing
The number of school divisions participating in the initiative has grown from 75 in the 2001-
"2002 school year, to 114 in the 2008-2009 school year. As well, the number of children"
"served has grown from 5,966 in the 2001-2002 school year to 15,657 children being served in"
2008-2009.
Children who attend the Virginia Preschool Initiative (VPI) continue to outperform other
kindergarten children on the Phonological Awareness Literacy Screening Kindergarten (PALS K)
"assessment. This screening tool, developed by the University of Virginia in collaboration with the"
"Virginia Department of Education, provides teachers with information on whether kindergarten"
children need extra support to become proficient readers by the time they reach third grade.
Children identified as needing extra support then receive reading intervention services in part
through the state-funded Early Intervention Reading Initiative (EIRI).
"In the fall of 2006, 11 percent of the children who had attended VPI in the previous year were"
"identified as needing extra support to become proficient readers, compared to 17 percent of all"
"kindergarten children screened. In the fall of 2007, 10 percent of children who had attended VPI"
the previous year needed additional support—the percent of all kindergarteners needing extra
support remained at 17 percent.
Economically Disadvantaged Preschoolers Need Services
An October 2007 report from the Weldon Cooper Center at the University of Virginia
showed that 40 percent of Virginia’s four-year-olds who are economically disadvantaged do
not experience preschool—of any level of quality. This is true despite the fact that Virginia
has made significant increases in the number of school divisions and children participating in
VPI in recent years.
"Without providing high quality preschool to all at-risk four-year-olds, many at-risk five-year-old"
children will continue to enter kindergarten without adequate preparation to be fully ready to learn.
