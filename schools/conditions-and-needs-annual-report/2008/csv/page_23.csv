"Preparation, Recruitment, and Retention of Educational Personnel"
"Ninety-eight percent of all core academic teachers are highly qualified, an increase from the previous"
"year. In 2007-2008 the state retained 91 percent of the workforce from the previous year,"
representing a 2 percent increase from the previous year. The percent of teachers retained for 3
years remains at 82 percent.
Recruiting Minority Teachers
"In Virginia in 2007-2008, 13 percent of teachers were Black and 2 percent were Hispanic, compared"
"with approximately 26 and 9 percent of students, respectively."
Objective 7: The Board of Education will provide leadership in implementing the provisions of
state and federal laws and regulations.
One of the Board’s priorities is to fulfill its obligations to meet the requirements of state and federal
"laws and regulations, and to assist local divisions, where necessary, to do the same."
"The Board, through the work of its School and Division Level Accountability Committee, has"
kept its fingers on the pulse of the reauthorization status of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001.
"This has been a time-consuming task, but one that is critically important. While the Congress’"
"reauthorization moves have apparently now stalled for 2008, the Board continues to monitor the"
regulations and pending reauthorization closely and to advocate for the modifications and waivers
that it has requested of the U.S. Department of Education.
Keeping Regulations Up-to-Date
"During 2008, the Board of Education initiated or completed the adoption or repeal of 29 of"
its 62 current regulations. Most revisions are to ensure that new provisions in the Code of
Virginia are reflected in the Board’s regulations.
"During 2008, the Board of Education initiated or completed the adoption or repeal of 29 of its 62"
current regulations. Most revisions are to ensure that new provisions in the Code of Virginia are
reflected in the Board’s regulations. Major revisions were made to the Regulations Governing Special
Education Programs for Students with Disabilities in Virginia. The revisions were in response to the recent
federal reauthorization of the law and regulations governing programs for students with disabilities.
Objective 8: The Board of Education will provide leadership to help schools and school
divisions ensure a safe and secure environment conducive to facilitating the teaching and
learning process.
Abuse Prevention Programs are Widespread in Virginia’s Schools
A recent report from the Virginia Department of Education showed that the funds for these
programs supported drug prevention programs and activities in 98 percent of local divisions
and violence prevention programs and activities in 96 percent of divisions. Programs funded
"by this federal program were provided in a total 1,475 Virginia schools representing 79"
percent of Virginia schools.
