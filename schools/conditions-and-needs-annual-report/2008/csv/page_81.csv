"Following the forum and public hearings, the Board of Education made the following"
recommendations to revise Standard Two of the Standards of Quality.
"Standard Two – Instructional, administrative, and support personnel."
2003 Board Recommendations:
• Require one full-time principal in each elementary school. [The SOQ currently requires a half-
time principal for elementary schools with fewer than 300 students.]
• Require one full-time assistant principal for each 400 students in each school. [The SOQ
currently requires one half-time assistant principal at an elementary school with between 600 and
899 students and one full-time assistant principal at an elementary school with 900 or more
students. The current middle and secondary assistant principal standard in the SOQ is for one
full-time assistant principal per 600 students in a school.]
"• Fund elementary resource teachers in art, music, and physical education. The proposal would"
"provide three periods per week for art, music, and physical education for students in grades K-5,"
assuming a 24:1 pupil-teacher ratio. This proposal translates into five instructional positions for
"every 1,000 students."
• Reduce the secondary school pupil to teacher funding ratio from 25:1 to 21:1 to support
scheduled planning time for secondary teachers.
• Reduce the state required speech language pathologist caseload from 68 to 60 students.
"• Fund two technology positions at 1 specialist per 1,000 students in grades K-12 division wide,"
"one to provide technology support, and one to serve as a resource teacher for instructional"
technology.
"• Require one full-time instructional position for each 1,000 students to serve as a reading"
specialist.
"• Revise the funding formula for the SOQ prevention, intervention, and remediation program."
The following recommended changes were enacted by the 2004 General Assembly in House Bills
1014 and Senate Bill 479:
"• Required local school boards to employ five positions per 1,000 students in grades kindergarten"
"through five to serve as elementary resource teachers in art, music, and physical education."
"(Effective July 1, 2005.)"
• Required local school boards to assign instructional personnel in a manner that produced
school wide ratios of students in average daily memberships to full-time equivalent teaching
positions of 21 to one in middle schools and high schools. School divisions were required to
"provide all middle and high school teachers with one planning period per day or the equivalent,"
"unencumbered of any teaching or supervisory duties. (Effective July 1, 2005.)"
"• Required local school boards to employ two positions per 1,000 students in grades kindergarten"
"through 12, one to provide technology support and one to serve as an instructional technology"
"resource teacher. (Effective July 1, 2005.)"
"• Established a funding formula for the prevention, intervention, and remediation program"
"proposed by the Board. (Effective July 1, 2004.) While the General Assembly passed the"
