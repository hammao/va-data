"For a number of years, Virginia’s public schools have participated in the Safe and Drug-Free Schools"
and Communities Act programs. Federal funding for these programs goes directly to the schools
and the Virginia Department of Education provides extensive technical assistance for local
implementation of these programs. A recent report showed that the funds for these programs
supported drug prevention programs and activities in 98 percent of local divisions and violence
prevention programs and activities in 96 percent of divisions. Prevention services were provided in
"a total 1,475 Virginia schools representing 79 percent of Virginia schools."
Consistent with the central focus of the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities
"programming, the activity reported most frequently across elementary, middle, and high school"
levels was age-appropriate drug and violence prevention activities. Ranking second across all levels
was dissemination of drug and violence prevention information to schools and communities.
Compliance with the Requirements of the
Standards of Quality
Section 22.1-18 of the Code of Virginia requires the Board of Education to “identify any school
divisions and the specific schools therein which have failed to establish and maintain schools
meeting the existing prescribed standards of quality.”
Fifty-four divisions reported full compliance with the provisions of the Standards of Quality (SOQ)
in the 2007-2008 school year (listed in Appendix D). Appendix E contains a list of school divisions
that have reported non-compliance with any of the provisions of the SOQ. The appendix also
provides additional information on the status of compliance over the last three years for these
divisions.
"Each year, staff members of the Department of Education collect self-assessment data from school"
divisions on their compliance with the provisions of § 22.1-253.13:1 through 22.1-253.13:8 of the
Code of Virginia (Standards of Quality). The chairman of the school board and division
superintendent certify the level of compliance with the standards and the individual indicators within
each standard to the Department of Education via an electronic data collection system.
"Where divisions indicate less than full compliance with the standards, corrective action plans for the"
"noncompliance items are required. Of the divisions that were not in full compliance, all have filed a"
corrective action plan. The data are for the 2007-2008 school year and for the Standards of Quality
"that were in effect as of July 1, 2007."
