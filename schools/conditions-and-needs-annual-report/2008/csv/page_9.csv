"responsible for the health and safety of students and staff while they are at school, on school"
"grounds, on their way to or from school, and involved in school-sponsored activities. The Board"
"must continue to stress the importance of successful, community-wide partnerships in the"
"development of procedures and policies that most effectively support healthy, safe, orderly and"
disciplined school environments.
The Need to Assist Chronically Low-Performing Schools
Aggressive interventions by the Virginia Department of Education and well-defined partnerships
between the Board of Education and local school boards have produced positive results in divisions
"previously identified as low-performing. In the 2007-2008 school year, 33 schools (2 percent) are"
"considered chronically low performing, compared to 42 schools in the previous year. Importantly,"
"with support from the Department of Education’s Office of School Improvement, 22 schools that"
were chronically low-performing in 2006-2007 were fully accredited this year.
"Preparation, Recruitment, and Retention of Educational Personnel"
Virginia is proud that 98 percent of all teachers are highly qualified. In 2007-2008 the state retained
"91 percent of the work force from the previous year, representing a 2 percent increase from the"
"previous year. The percent of teachers retained for 3 years remains at 82 percent. Of course, these"
"teachers must be talented, caring, and well prepared. Schools in some geographic areas already are"
"unable to recruit enough talented teachers, particularly in fields such as mathematics, science and"
special education.
A focus of the No Child Left Behind act of 2001 (NCLB) is to eliminate the disparity between non-
highly-qualified teachers in low-poverty schools and those in high-poverty schools. The Virginia
"Department of Education is tracking the state’s progress in this regard, and it remains a critical area"
of need.
Recruiting Minority Teachers
The gap between the diversity of students in the schools and the ethnic characteristics of the
teaching force poses a key question: will teachers reflect the tremendous diversity of the students
"they will serve? Not without a concerted effort. In Virginia, 13 percent of teachers are Black and 2"
"percent are Hispanic, compared with approximately 26 and 9 percent of students, respectively."
High-Quality Preschool Programs
The number of school divisions participating in the Virginia Preschool Initiative has grown from 75
"in the 2001-2002 school year, to 114 in the 2008-2009 school year. Also, the number of children"
"served has grown from 5,966 in the 2001-2002 school year to 15,657 children being served in 2008-"
"2009. Despite this growth, the number of at-risk four-year olds in Virginia continues to be a"
"concern. Without providing high quality preschool to all at-risk four-year olds, many at-risk five"
year old children will continue to enter kindergarten without adequate preparation to be fully ready
to learn.
