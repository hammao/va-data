"While Virginia students outperformed their peers nationwide in writing for a third consecutive time,"
"their average score was unchanged from 2002, and there was little change in proficiency levels."
"Ninety percent of Virginia students demonstrated at least basic writing skills on the 2007 test, and 31"
percent met or exceeded the rigorous NAEP standard for full proficiency.
"Black eighth grade students in Virginia achieved an average score of 142, compared with the national"
average of 140. Eighty-four percent of Black students in the commonwealth demonstrated at least
"basic proficiency in writing, and 14 percent performed at the proficient level or better."
Hispanic students achieved an average score of 145 compared with the national average of 141.
"Eighty-two percent of Hispanic students tested at the basic level or better, and 18 percent"
performed at the proficient level or above. While the average score of Hispanic students in Virginia
"has declined since 1998, the changes are not considered significant because of the small numbers of"
students assessed.
On-Time Graduation Rates
More than 81 percent of the students in the class of 2008 graduated on time with a diploma. The
"graduation rates for the commonwealth, school divisions and high schools were calculated for the"
first time by tracking individual students from year to year using the commonwealth’s longitudinal
"student data system. This new, more accurate statistic is known as the Virginia On-Time Graduation"
Rate.
The Virginia On-Time Graduation Rate is a cohort graduation rate that expresses the percentage of
students who earn a Board of Education-approved diploma within four years of entering ninth grade
for the first time. It is calculated using a formula endorsed in a 2005 compact signed by the nation’s
governors and subsequently adopted by the General Assembly and Board of Education.
Percentages are based on longitudinal student-level data and account for student mobility and
retention practices. Students with disabilities and English-language learners are counted as “on-time”
graduates even if they require more than the standard four years to earn a diploma.
"For a fifth consecutive year, the number of Virginia students graduating with an Advanced Studies"
Diploma increased and the number of advanced diplomas awarded exceeded the number of
Standard Diplomas.
"Of the 96,979 students in this year’s cohort, 78,805, or 81.3 percent, earned a Board of Education-"
"approved diploma. Of these on-time graduates, 41,888, or 53.2 percent, earned an Advanced Studies"
"Diploma; 33,151, or 42.1 percent, earned a Standard Diploma; 1,820, or 2.3 percent, earned a"
"Modified Standard Diploma; 1,930, or 2.4 percent, earned a Special Diploma; and 16 students"
earned a General Achievement Diploma. Modified Standard Diplomas and Special Diplomas are
available only to students with disabilities. General Achievement Diplomas are earned by overage
students.
