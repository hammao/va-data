for all schools and especially those elementary schools that do not have fulltime principals. In
"those school buildings without a principal or assistant principal, a common practice is to assign a"
"designee, usually a resource teacher, who must stop instructional lessons with students to deal"
with the many situations that arise on a daily basis. The SOQ currently requires one half-time
assistant principal at an elementary school with between 600 and 899 students and one full-time
assistant principal at an elementary school with 900 or more students. The current middle and
secondary assistant principal standard in the SOQ is for one full-time assistant principal per 600
students in a school. The demands and responsibilities of assistant principals have intensified
based on the increasing complexity of the principal’s role.
RESOURCE TEACHERS: Local school boards shall employ five full-time equivalent positions per
"1,000 students in grades kindergarten through five to serve as elementary resource teachers in"
"art, music, and physical education."
This funding is part of the Basic Aid calculation described above.
Studies show that participation in the arts and physical education may contribute to improved
student performance and increased achievement on test scores.
"The inclusion of art, music, and physical education is considered necessary for students’"
responsible participation in American society. The Standards of Accreditation (SOA) require the
"provision of instruction in art, music, and physical education and health for students at the"
"elementary, middle, and high school levels. Standard units of credit in health and physical"
education and in the fine or practical arts are included in the graduation requirements provided in
the SOA.
TECHNOLOGY POSITIONS: Local school boards shall employ two full-time equivalent positions
"per 1,000 students in grades kindergarten through 12, one to provide technology support and one"
to serve as an instructional technology resource teacher.
This funding is part of the Basic Aid calculation described above.
"As the availability and use of educational technology in schools has increased, it became evident"
that there is a growing need to provide personnel support for technical and instructional needs.
The Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission (JLARC) to recommend a state funding
formula for educational technology and technology support personnel. To integrate technology
"into instruction, an adequate system of support in schools is necessary. The purpose of the"
technology specialist position is to provide school-level technical assistance to teachers and
students in the use of technology. Technical support consists mainly of centralized and school-
"based support for information networks, such as selection, configuration, installation, operation,"
"repair, and maintenance. The Board of Education has approved Standards of Learning"
technology standards for K-12 students and technology standards for instructional personnel
(TSIP).
"SUPPORT COSTS: For the purposes of this title, unless the context otherwise requires, ""support"
"services"" shall include services provided by the school board members; the superintendent;"
"assistant superintendents; student services (including social workers, homebound, improvement,"
"and principal's office); attendance and health positions; administrative, technical, and clerical"
positions; operation and maintenance positions; technology support positions; school nurses; and
pupil transportation positions.

transportation; 3) attendance and health; 4) substitute teachers; 5) professional development; 6)
operations and maintenance; 7) superintendent and board member costs; and 8) facilities and
