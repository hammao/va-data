§ 22.1-253.13:4. Standard 4. Student achievement and graduation requirements.
"A. Each local school board shall award diplomas to all secondary school students, including"
"students who transfer from nonpublic schools or from home instruction, who earn the units of"
"credit prescribed by the Board of Education, pass the prescribed tests, and meet such other"
requirements as may be prescribed by the local school board and approved by the Board of
Education. Provisions shall be made to facilitate the transfer and appropriate grade placement of
"students from other public secondary schools, from nonpublic schools, or from home instruction"
as outlined in the standards for accreditation.
"Further, reasonable accommodation to meet the requirements for diplomas shall be provided for"
otherwise qualified students with disabilities as needed.
"In addition, each local school board may devise, vis-à-vis the award of diplomas to secondary"
"school students, a mechanism for calculating class rankings that takes into consideration whether"
the student has taken a required class more than one time and has had any prior earned grade
for such required class expunged.
Each local school board shall notify the parents of rising eleventh and twelfth grade students of (i)
the number and subject area requirements of standard and verified units of credit required for
graduation pursuant to the standards for accreditation and (ii) the remaining number and subject
area requirements of such units of credit the individual student requires for graduation.
B. Students identified as disabled who complete the requirements of their individualized
education programs shall be awarded special diplomas by local school boards.
Each local school board shall notify the parent of such students with disabilities who have an
individualized education program and who fail to meet the requirements for a standard or
"advanced studies diploma of the student's right to a free and appropriate education to age 21,"
"inclusive, pursuant to Article 2 (§ 22.1-213 et seq.) of Chapter 13 of this title."
C. Students who have completed a prescribed course of study as defined by the local school
board shall be awarded certificates of program completion by local school boards if they are not
"eligible to receive a standard, advanced studies, modified standard, special or general"
achievement diploma.
Each local school board shall provide notification of the right to a free public education for
"students who have not reached 20 years of age on or before August 1 of the school year,"
"pursuant to Chapter 1 (§ 22.1-1 et seq.) of this title, to the parent of students who fail to graduate"
or who have failed to achieve the number of verified units of credit required for graduation as
provided in the standards of accreditation. If such student who does not graduate or achieve such
"verified units of credit is a student for whom English is a second language, the local school board"
shall notify the parent of the student's opportunity for a free public education in accordance with §
22.1-5.
"D. In establishing course and credit requirements for a high school diploma, the Board shall:"
1. Provide for the selection of integrated learning courses meeting the Standards of Learning and

"Learning testing, as necessary;"
"2. Establish the requirements for a standard, modified standard, or advanced studies high school"
"diploma, which shall include one credit in fine or performing arts or career and technical"
education and one credit in United States and Virginia history. The requirements for a standard
"high school diploma shall, however, include at least two sequential electives chosen from a"
concentration of courses selected from a variety of options that may be planned to ensure the
completion of a focused sequence of elective courses. Students may take such focused
sequence of elective courses in consecutive years or any two years of high school. Such focused
sequence of elective courses shall provide a foundation for further education or training or
