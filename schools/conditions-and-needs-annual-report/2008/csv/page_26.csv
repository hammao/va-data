Vernon Johns Middle was denied accreditation for a second consecutive year; the other Petersburg
schools listed are entering their third year without state accreditation. The 2006 memorandum of
understanding between Petersburg Public Schools and the Board of Education set a goal of full
accreditation for at least five of the division’s schools by 2008. With five of Petersburg’s seven
"schools denied accreditation, the state board requested that the Petersburg Public Schools move"
forward with a plan to provide an independently managed middle school program in 2009-2010 for
all students in the city who wish to attend.
Accredited with Warning
"The number of schools accredited with warning decreased to 54, compared with 102 last year."
"Eighty-three schools that were on academic warning last year achieved full accreditation, including"
"22 elementary schools, 52 middle schools, two high schools and seven combined schools. See"
Appendix F for a listing of all schools rated accredited with warning.
Conditional Accreditation
Twenty-three newly opened schools were automatically rated as conditionally accredited (new
schools) for 2008-2009.
"In addition, the Board of Education granted conditional accreditation to thirteen schools that have"
not met accreditation standards for four or more years. Schools that are granted conditional
accreditation have three years to raise student achievement to state standards and must apply
annually for this rating. These schools are working closely with the Virginia Department of
Education’s Office of School Improvement and are taking dramatic and meaningful actions to
improve instruction and raise student achievement to state standards. Additional information is
contained in Appendix F.
How Ratings are Determined
The accreditation ratings are based on the achievement of students on SOL assessments and
"approved substitute tests in English, mathematics, science, history and social science administered"
"during the summer and fall of 2007 and the spring of 2008, or on overall achievement during the"
"three most recent academic years. Also included are results of the Virginia Grade Level Assessment,"
"the Virginia Alternate Assessment Program, and the Virginia Substitute Evaluation Program. The"
results of tests administered in each subject area are combined to produce overall school passing
"percentages in English, mathematics, history and science."
"In middle schools and high schools, a pass rate of at least 70 percent in all four subject areas is"
"required for full accreditation. In elementary schools, a combined pass rate of at least 75 percent on"
English tests in grades 3-5 is required for full accreditation. Elementary schools also must achieve
"pass rates of at least 70 percent in mathematics, grade-5 science and grade-5 history, and pass rates"
of at least 50 percent in grade-3 science and grade-3 history.
Accreditation ratings may reflect adjustments made for schools that successfully remediate students
who failed reading or mathematics tests during the previous year. Adjustments also may be made for
students with limited-English proficiency and for students who have recently transferred into a
Virginia public school.
