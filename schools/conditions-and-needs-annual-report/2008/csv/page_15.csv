The Board’s Performance Measures:
Addressing the Needs of Virginia’s Public Schools
Along with each objective is an outline of specific strategies to be implemented to accomplish the
objective. Also included is a description of various measures that will be used to help the Board
determine its progress toward meeting the objectives. The objectives were set by the Board to
address the complex challenges that impact our schools and our young people. The following
information provides an overview of where we stand in meeting those objectives.
Objective 1: The Board of Education will continue to enhance the quality standards for all
public schools in Virginia.
"In November 2008, the Board of Education adopted a resolution that acknowledges the economic"
conditions facing the Commonwealth in the next year. The resolution also acknowledges the
challenges that are before the Governor and the General Assembly to deal with budget constraints
"while protecting core services in the area of Pk-12 education. In the resolution, the Board stated its"
SOQ priorities to the Governor and the General Assembly for their consideration in the 2009
"General Assembly Session. Moreover, the Board affirms its support for those provisions of the"
Standards of Quality that have been recommended by the Board in recent years and that are yet to
"be adopted and funded, and the Board stated its intent to request approval and full funding of these"
staffing requirements beginning in the next biennium.
"Further, the resolution outlines the Board’s requests for approval during the 2009 Session of"
“intermediate SOQ implementation options” that would enable school divisions to use existing
"SOQ and incentive program funding to hire data coordinators, reading specialists, mathematics"
"teacher specialists, and English Language Learner (ELL) teachers to provide additional support in"
classrooms.
"The Board of Education regularly reviews and revises the Standards of Quality (SOQ), Standards of"
"Accreditation (SOA), and Standards of Learning (SOL). Throughout this process, the Board"
collects data and information that support its ability to thoughtfully and deliberately make revisions
that are designed to enhance the quality of the standards to which Virginia’s students are held. The
Board has continued to advocate for adoption and funding for the prescribed revisions to the SOQ.
More detailed information on the history of the Board’s recommendations regarding the SOQ may
be seen in Appendix G.
"In addition, the SOA is currently under revision to address the need to clearly define the"
requirements for the technical diplomas and to outline the graduation rate requirements to be placed
on local schools.
