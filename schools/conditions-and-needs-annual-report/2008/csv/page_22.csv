"For the long run, however, results show a positive trend. Over the past three years, pass rates on"
statewide assessments have increased in nearly all grade levels and subjects tested tested. Pass rates
in reading range from a low of 83 percent in eighth grade to a high of 94 percent on end-of-course
"assessments. Over the same time period, pass rates on the statewide writing assessment have"
"declined in grades 5 and 8, and remained the same for two years on the end-of-course assessments."
"Writing assessment pass rates in grades five and eight are 87 percent, and 92 percent on the end-of-"
course assessment.
Virginia has a new initiative that will help parents select books that will strengthen their children’s
reading skills. When elementary and middle school students receive their Standards of Learning
"(SOL) test reports next spring and summer, their reading scores will be accompanied by a"
corresponding “Lexile measure” parents can use to select books. A Lexile measure ranks reading
"ability and text difficulty on a single scale, allowing parents — and teachers — to select books at or"
"slightly above a student’s reading level. Currently, more than 115,000 books have been assigned a"
Lexile measure. Adding Lexile measures to SOL reports also supports the Board’s objective of
increasing early reading skills and the Board of Education’s focus on improving adolescent literacy.
Objective 6: The Board of Education will establish policies and standards that enhance the
"preparation, recruitment, and retention of educational personnel, including their"
"meaningful, ongoing professional development."
New Virginia Standards for the Professional Practice of Teachers
The standards will assist teachers to reflect on student learning and teaching and to develop
professional development plans to improve teaching practice.
Standards for Teachers
"The Board adopted Virginia Standards for the Professional Practice of Teachers, a resource for the"
implementation of the Board of Education’s performance standards criteria. The standards represent
the knowledge and skills that are common to all teachers from pre-kindergarten through grade 12.
Teachers need to know what will be expected of them and how they will be evaluated. The
standards will assist teachers to reflect on student learning and teaching and to develop professional
development plans to improve teaching practice.
Recruiting and Retaining Excellent and Diverse Teachers
"Ninety-eight percent of all teachers are highly qualified, an increase from the previous year."
"Thirteen percent of teachers were Black and 2 percent were Hispanic, compared with"
"approximately 26 and 9 percent of students, respectively."
