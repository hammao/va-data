Dear Governor Kaine and Members of the Virginia General Assembly:
"On behalf of the Board of Education, I am pleased to transmit the 2008 Annual Report on the"
"Condition and Needs of Public Schools in Virginia, submitted pursuant to § 22.1-18 of the Code of Virginia."
"The report contains information about the condition and needs of Virginia’s public schools,"
including an analysis of student academic performance and a report on the local divisions’
compliance with the requirements of the Standards of Quality and the Standards of Accreditation.
"Additional copies of the report are available by contacting Dr. Margaret Roberts, executive assistant"
"to the Board of Education, P.O. Box 2120, Richmond, VA 23218; 804/ 225-2924;"
Margaret.Roberts@doe.virginia.gov.
The report contains compelling evidence that our schools and our students are achieving at higher
"levels, and it also points out evidence that serious and persistent problems remain to be tackled."
"The progress shown by our public schools is the result of ongoing collaboration, dedication,"
"workable strategies, and wise use of resources, both human and financial. It is the result of the hard"
"work of students, teachers, administrators, support staff, parents, and supporters throughout the"
Commonwealth.
We see a challenging year ahead as we face the economic headwinds that have developed in recent
"months; however, we remain focused on the fundamentals of improving instruction for all students."
"Working together with school and community leaders and private partners, we can harness the"
power of people to improve education. Be assured that the challenges will be addressed with that
same cooperative resolve.
The Board of Education is grateful for the support the Governor and General Assembly continue to
"give to Virginia’s school improvement efforts. As we look to the future, the members of the Board"
of Education pledge to remain focused on providing the best educational opportunities and the
brightest future for the young people enrolled in Virginia’s public schools.
"Sincerely,"
Mark E. Emblidge
"President, Board of Education"
