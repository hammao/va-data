"Remediation programs shall include, when applicable, a procedure for early identification of"
students who are at risk of failing the Standards of Learning assessments in grades three through
eight or who fail an end-of-course test required for the award of a verified unit of credit required
for the student's graduation. Such programs may also include summer school for all elementary
"and middle school grades and for all high school academic courses, as defined by regulations"
"promulgated by the Board of Education, or other forms of remediation. Summer school"
remediation programs or other forms of remediation shall be chosen by the division
superintendent to be appropriate to the academic needs of the student. Students who are
required to attend such summer school programs or to participate in another form of remediation
shall not be charged tuition by the school division.
"The requirement for remediation may, however, be satisfied by the student's attendance in a"
"program of prevention, intervention or remediation that has been selected by his parent, in"
"consultation with the division superintendent or his designee, and is either (i) conducted by an"
accredited private school or (ii) a special program that has been determined to be comparable to
the required public school remediation program by the division superintendent. The costs of such
private school remediation program or other special remediation program shall be borne by the
student's parent.
The Board of Education shall establish standards for full funding of summer remedial programs
"that shall include, but not be limited to, the minimum number of instructional hours or the"
equivalent thereof required for full funding and an assessment system designed to evaluate
program effectiveness. Based on the number of students attending and the Commonwealth's
"share of the per pupil instructional costs, state funds shall be provided for the full cost of summer"
"and other remediation programs as set forth in the appropriation act, provided such programs"
"comply with such standards as shall be established by the Board, pursuant to § 22.1-199.2."
D. Local school boards shall also implement the following:
1. Programs in grades K through three that emphasize developmentally appropriate learning to
enhance success.
"2. Programs based on prevention, intervention, or remediation designed to increase the number"
of students who earn a high school diploma and to prevent students from dropping out of school.
Such programs shall include components that are research-based.
3. Career and technical education programs incorporated into the K through 12 curricula that
include:
"a. Knowledge of careers and all types of employment opportunities including, but not limited to,"
"apprenticeships, entrepreneurship and small business ownership, the military, and the teaching"
"profession, and emphasize the advantages of completing school with marketable skills;"
b. Career exploration opportunities in the middle school grades; and
c. Competency-based career and technical education programs that integrate academic
"outcomes, career guidance and job-seeking skills for all secondary students. Programs must be"
based upon labor market needs and student interest. Career guidance shall include counseling
about available employment opportunities and placement services for students exiting school.
Each school board shall develop and implement a plan to ensure compliance with the provisions
of this subdivision. Such plan shall be developed with the input of area business and industry
representatives and local community colleges and shall be submitted to the Superintendent of
Public Instruction in accordance with the timelines established by federal law.
4. Early identification of students with disabilities and enrollment of such students in appropriate
instructional programs consistent with state and federal law.
5. Early identification of gifted students and enrollment of such students in appropriately
differentiated instructional programs.
6. Educational alternatives for students whose needs are not met in programs prescribed
elsewhere in these standards. Such students shall be counted in average daily membership
(ADM) in accordance with the regulations of the Board of Education.
