2008 STANDARDS OF QUALITY AS AMENDED
§ 22.1-253.13:1. Standard 1. Instructional programs supporting the Standards of
Learning and other educational objectives.
A. The General Assembly and the Board of Education believe that the fundamental goal of the
public schools of this Commonwealth must be to enable each student to develop the skills that
"are necessary for success in school, preparation for life, and reaching their full potential. The"
General Assembly and the Board of Education find that the quality of education is dependent
"upon the provision of (i) the appropriate working environment, benefits, and salaries necessary to"
ensure the availability of high-quality instructional personnel; (ii) the appropriate learning
environment designed to promote student achievement; (iii) quality instruction that enables each
student to become a productive and educated citizen of Virginia and the United States of
"America; and (iv) the adequate commitment of other resources. In keeping with this goal, the"
"General Assembly shall provide for the support of public education as set forth in Article VIII,"
Section 1 of the Constitution of Virginia.
B. The Board of Education shall establish educational objectives known as the Standards of
"Learning, which shall form the core of Virginia's educational program, and other educational"
"objectives, which together are designed to ensure the development of the skills that are"
"necessary for success in school and for preparation for life in the years beyond. At a minimum,"
"the Board shall establish Standards of Learning for English, mathematics, science, and history"
and social science. The Standards of Learning shall not be construed to be regulations as defined
in § 2.2-4001.
The Board shall seek to ensure that the Standards of Learning are consistent with a high quality
"foundation educational program. The Standards of Learning shall include, but not be limited to,"
"the basic skills of communication (listening, speaking, reading, and writing); computation and"
critical reasoning including problem solving and decision making; proficiency in the use of
computers and related technology; and the skills to manage personal finances and to make
sound financial decisions.
The English Standards of Learning for reading in kindergarten through grade three shall be based
"on components of effective reading instruction, to include, at a minimum, phonemic awareness,"
"phonics, fluency, vocabulary development, and text comprehension."
The Standards of Learning in all subject areas shall be subject to regular review and revision to
maintain rigor and to reflect a balance between content knowledge and the application of
knowledge in preparation for eventual employment and lifelong learning.
"The Board of Education shall establish a regular schedule, in a manner it deems appropriate, for"
"the review, and revision as may be necessary, of the Standards of Learning in all subject areas."
Such review of each subject area shall occur at least once every seven years. Nothing in this
section shall be construed to prohibit the Board from conducting such review and revision on a
more frequent basis.
"To provide appropriate opportunity for input from the general public, teachers, and local school"
"boards, the Board of Education shall conduct public hearings prior to establishing revised"
"Standards of Learning. Thirty days prior to conducting such hearings, the Board shall give notice"
"of the date, time, and place of the hearings to all local school boards and any other persons"
requesting to be notified of the hearings and publish notice of its intention to revise the Standards
of Learning in the Virginia Register of Regulations.
Interested parties shall be given reasonable opportunity to be heard and present information prior
to final adoption of any revisions of the Standards of Learning.
