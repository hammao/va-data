"The Honorable Timothy Kaine, Governor"
Members of the Virginia General Assembly
Commonwealth of Virginia
"Richmond, Virginia 23219"
Dear Governor Kaine and Members of the Virginia General Assembly:
"On behalf of the Board of Education, I am pleased to transmit the 2008 Annual Report on the"
"Condition and Needs of Public Schools in Virginia, submitted pursuant to § 22.1-18 of the Code of Virginia."
"The report contains information about the condition and needs of Virginia’s public schools,"
including an analysis of student academic performance and a report on the local divisions’
compliance with the requirements of the Standards of Quality and the Standards of Accreditation.
"Additional copies of the report are available by contacting Dr. Margaret Roberts, executive assistant"
"to the Board of Education, P.O. Box 2120, Richmond, VA 23218; 804/ 225-2924;"
Margaret.Roberts@doe.virginia.gov.
The report contains compelling evidence that our schools and our students are achieving at higher
"levels, and it also points out evidence that serious and persistent problems remain to be tackled."
"The progress shown by our public schools is the result of ongoing collaboration, dedication,"
"workable strategies, and wise use of resources, both human and financial. It is the result of the hard"
"work of students, teachers, administrators, support staff, parents, and supporters throughout the"
Commonwealth.
We see a challenging year ahead as we face the economic headwinds that have developed in recent
"months; however, we remain focused on the fundamentals of improving instruction for all students."
"Working together with school and community leaders and private partners, we can harness the"
power of people to improve education. Be assured that the challenges will be addressed with that
same cooperative resolve.
The Board of Education is grateful for the support the Governor and General Assembly continue to
"give to Virginia’s school improvement efforts. As we look to the future, the members of the Board"
of Education pledge to remain focused on providing the best educational opportunities and the
brightest future for the young people enrolled in Virginia’s public schools.
"Sincerely,"
Mark E. Emblidge
"President, Board of Education"

academic gains and receive national recognition for achievement and innovation. Highlights include:,academic gains and receive national recognition for achievement and innovation. Highlights include:
•,Ninety-five percent of Virginia’s public schools are fully accredited and meeting state
,"standards for student achievement in English, mathematics, history and science based on"
,2007-2008 assessment results. This is the highest percentage of schools reaching full
,accreditation since the commonwealth began statewide testing ten years ago.
•,Black and Hispanic students continued to narrow achievement gaps with White students in
,"mathematics on state tests administered during 2007-2008. During the last three years, the"
,gaps have narrowed by four points for Black students and two points for Hispanic students
,even though the achievement of White students increased by seven points.
•,"During the last three years, the achievement gap between Black and White students in"
,"reading has narrowed by three points, despite a two-point increase in reading for White"
,students. Hispanic students also have narrowed the achievement gap with White students by
,three points during the last three years.
•,More than 81 percent of the students in the class of 2008 graduated on time with a diploma.
,"The graduation rates for the state, school divisions, and high schools were calculated for the"
,first time this year by tracking individual students from year to year using Virginia’s
,longitudinal student data system.
•,The performance of Virginia public school graduates on the SAT improved significantly in
,2008. Although the total number of Virginia public school students taking the SAT dropped
,"by 2.3 percent, the number of minority students taking the tests increased, with minority"
,students now making up one-third of all test takers.
,6
•,Virginia boasts the nation’s third-highest percentage of high school seniors earning a grade
,"of 3 or better on Advanced Placement (AP) examinations. Only two states, New York and"
,"Maryland, had higher percentages of seniors earning grades of 3 or better on AP tests during"
,2007.
•,"For a fourth consecutive year, the percentage of Virginia students graduating with an"
,Advanced Studies Diploma increased and the number of advanced diplomas awarded was
,greater than the number of Standard Diplomas.
•,Virginia was the only state to receive a perfect score for academic standards from the
,American Federation of Teachers (AFT) in the union’s Sizing Up Standards 2008 report.
•,The influential Thomas B. Fordham Institute last year awarded Virginia an “A” for its
,coverage of world history in the History and Social Science Standards of Learning and praised the
,standards as “a model of clarity.”
•,Results from the 2007 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) show that the
,reading and mathematics skills of Virginia students continue to improve and that Virginia’s
,students remain among the nation’s highest achievers in these subjects.
•,NAEP results also show that in no state did Black fourth and eighth graders perform at a
,statistically higher level in reading and mathematics than Black students in Virginia. Virginia
,also was the only state where Black students improved their performance in mathematics at
,grade levels four and eight from 2005 to 2007.
•,Virginia students outperformed students nationwide on the 2007 NAEP writing test.
,Virginia students scored significantly higher than students in 20 other states. Test takers in
,only seven states achieved significantly higher average scores.

Objective 7: The Board of Education will provide leadership in implementing the provisions of state and
federal laws and regulations.
Objective 8: The Board of Education will provide leadership to help schools and school divisions
ensure a safe and secure environment conducive to facilitating the teaching and learning process.
Critical Areas of Need: The Board’s objectives—and the performance measures used to gauge our
progress in meeting those objectives—focus on the most critical needs of the public schools. These
needs include the following:
"Funding the Standards of Quality (SOQ): In November 2008, the Board of Education adopted a"
resolution that acknowledges the economic conditions facing the Commonwealth in the next year.
The resolution also acknowledges the challenges that are before the Governor and the General
Assembly to deal with budget constraints while protecting core services in the area of Pk-12
"education. In the resolution, the Board stated its SOQ priorities to the Governor and the General"
"Assembly for their consideration in the 2009 General Assembly Session. Moreover, the Board"
affirmed its support for those provisions of the Standards of Quality that have been recommended
"by the Board in recent years and that are yet to be adopted and funded, and the Board stated its"
intent to request approval and full funding of these staffing requirements beginning in the next
biennium.
"Further, the resolution outlines the Board’s requests for approval during the 2009 Session of the"
General Assembly in the form of “intermediate SOQ implementation options” that would enable
"school divisions to use existing SOQ and incentive program funding to hire data coordinators,"
"reading specialists, mathematics teacher specialists, and English Language Learner (ELL) teachers to"
provide additional support in classrooms. A description of the four SOQ options is contained in the
body of the annual report.
A Persistent Achievement Gap: Virginia is making progress in eliminating achievement gaps among
"groups of students. Nonetheless, in one-quarter of Virginia’s schools, pass rates for economically"
disadvantaged students are more than 10 percent lower than for all students in the same schools; in
"more than half of our schools, pass rates for economically disadvantaged students are more than 5"
"percentage points lower than the pass rate for all students. Furthermore, Black and Hispanic"
students have pass rates that are more than 10 percent lower than for all students in 18 and 43
"percent of schools, respectively."
"Compounding the problem, economically disadvantaged students and minority students are less"
"likely than all students to graduate in four years. There is a 9-, 11-, and 12- point achievement gap"
"for Black, Hispanic, and economically disadvantaged students, respectively, compared to the overall"
graduation rate.
Safe and Healthy Environments for Students and Teachers: A high priority for the Board is dealing
effectively with the realities of schooling for some children who face difficult personal circumstances
"such as high poverty, high crime in their neighborhoods, high rates of unhealthy behaviors, poor"
"nutrition, and other circumstances that obstruct their learning at school. The Board of Education"
"must help local divisions by providing solid, workable guidelines and policies to assist those who are"
8
"responsible for the health and safety of students and staff while they are at school, on school"
"grounds, on their way to or from school, and involved in school-sponsored activities. The Board"
"must continue to stress the importance of successful, community-wide partnerships in the"
"development of procedures and policies that most effectively support healthy, safe, orderly and"
disciplined school environments.
The Need to Assist Chronically Low-Performing Schools
Aggressive interventions by the Virginia Department of Education and well-defined partnerships
between the Board of Education and local school boards have produced positive results in divisions
"previously identified as low-performing. In the 2007-2008 school year, 33 schools (2 percent) are"
"considered chronically low performing, compared to 42 schools in the previous year. Importantly,"
"with support from the Department of Education’s Office of School Improvement, 22 schools that"
were chronically low-performing in 2006-2007 were fully accredited this year.
"Preparation, Recruitment, and Retention of Educational Personnel"
Virginia is proud that 98 percent of all teachers are highly qualified. In 2007-2008 the state retained
"91 percent of the work force from the previous year, representing a 2 percent increase from the"
"previous year. The percent of teachers retained for 3 years remains at 82 percent. Of course, these"
"teachers must be talented, caring, and well prepared. Schools in some geographic areas already are"
"unable to recruit enough talented teachers, particularly in fields such as mathematics, science and"
special education.
A focus of the No Child Left Behind act of 2001 (NCLB) is to eliminate the disparity between non-
highly-qualified teachers in low-poverty schools and those in high-poverty schools. The Virginia
"Department of Education is tracking the state’s progress in this regard, and it remains a critical area"
of need.
Recruiting Minority Teachers
The gap between the diversity of students in the schools and the ethnic characteristics of the
teaching force poses a key question: will teachers reflect the tremendous diversity of the students
"they will serve? Not without a concerted effort. In Virginia, 13 percent of teachers are Black and 2"
"percent are Hispanic, compared with approximately 26 and 9 percent of students, respectively."
High-Quality Preschool Programs
The number of school divisions participating in the Virginia Preschool Initiative has grown from 75
"in the 2001-2002 school year, to 114 in the 2008-2009 school year. Also, the number of children"
"served has grown from 5,966 in the 2001-2002 school year to 15,657 children being served in 2008-"
"2009. Despite this growth, the number of at-risk four-year olds in Virginia continues to be a"
"concern. Without providing high quality preschool to all at-risk four-year olds, many at-risk five"
year old children will continue to enter kindergarten without adequate preparation to be fully ready
to learn.
9
A huge step forward to address this issue is the newly created Office of Early Childhood
Development is now coordinating state programs aimed at improving the lives and education of the
commonwealth’s youngest citizens and residents. The office represents an inter-agency approach to
"managing services for young children and their families, with the staff reporting to both the Virginia"
Department of Education and the Virginia Department of Social Services.
The Office of Early Childhood Development is responsible for coordinating services for children
"from birth to age 5, including the Virginia Preschool Initiative, Head Start, childcare subsidies,"
provider services and other state-level efforts to advance early childhood development and learning.
The office also will work through a liaison with the Virginia Department of Health to ensure the
integration of health-related programs.
Twenty-first Century Literacy Skills
"In 2007-2008, 87 percent of Virginia’s students passed the Standards of Learning English"
"assessments, compared to 85 percent in the previous year. Also, 84 percent of students passed the"
"statewide mathematics tests, up from 80 percent the previous year. Given the critical importance of"
"reading and mathematics for life success, it is critical that the Board continue to emphasize these"
skills. While more than 81 percent of the students in the class of 2008 graduated on time with a
"diploma, almost 20 percent of our students are not graduating on time with their class. We need to"
"know why that is, and we need to address the needs of these students so that everyone graduates"
successfully.
Virginia has a new initiative that will help parents select books that will strengthen their children’s
reading skills. When elementary and middle school students receive their Standards of Learning
"(SOL) test reports next spring and summer, their reading scores will be accompanied by a"
corresponding “Lexile measure” parents can use to select books. A Lexile measure ranks reading
"ability and text difficulty on a single scale, allowing parents — and teachers — to select books at or"
slightly above a student’s reading level.
Promoting Parental and Family Involvement
The family and the home are both critical education institutions where children begin learning long
"before they start school, and where they spend much of their time after they start school. It stands"
to reason that involving parents in their child’s education is conducive to learning. Such
"involvement is critical if we are to improve the educational achievement of Virginia’s students,"
"promote safe and healthy school environments, and eliminate achievement gaps. To do this, schools"
need to promote and enhance cooperative partnerships in which families are allies in the efforts of
teachers and schools.

Specific strategies to be used by the Board of Education to meet the above objectives may be found
in the Board of Education’s Comprehensive Plan for 2007-2012. This document may be viewed at:
http://www.doe.virginia.gov/VDOE/VA_Board/comprehensiveplan.pdf
The Board’s Performance Measures:
Addressing the Needs of Virginia’s Public Schools
Along with each objective is an outline of specific strategies to be implemented to accomplish the
objective. Also included is a description of various measures that will be used to help the Board
determine its progress toward meeting the objectives. The objectives were set by the Board to
address the complex challenges that impact our schools and our young people. The following
information provides an overview of where we stand in meeting those objectives.
Objective 1: The Board of Education will continue to enhance the quality standards for all
public schools in Virginia.
"In November 2008, the Board of Education adopted a resolution that acknowledges the economic"
conditions facing the Commonwealth in the next year. The resolution also acknowledges the
challenges that are before the Governor and the General Assembly to deal with budget constraints
"while protecting core services in the area of Pk-12 education. In the resolution, the Board stated its"
SOQ priorities to the Governor and the General Assembly for their consideration in the 2009
"General Assembly Session. Moreover, the Board affirms its support for those provisions of the"
Standards of Quality that have been recommended by the Board in recent years and that are yet to
"be adopted and funded, and the Board stated its intent to request approval and full funding of these"
staffing requirements beginning in the next biennium.
"Further, the resolution outlines the Board’s requests for approval during the 2009 Session of"
“intermediate SOQ implementation options” that would enable school divisions to use existing
"SOQ and incentive program funding to hire data coordinators, reading specialists, mathematics"
"teacher specialists, and English Language Learner (ELL) teachers to provide additional support in"
classrooms.
"The Board of Education regularly reviews and revises the Standards of Quality (SOQ), Standards of"
"Accreditation (SOA), and Standards of Learning (SOL). Throughout this process, the Board"
collects data and information that support its ability to thoughtfully and deliberately make revisions
that are designed to enhance the quality of the standards to which Virginia’s students are held. The
Board has continued to advocate for adoption and funding for the prescribed revisions to the SOQ.
More detailed information on the history of the Board’s recommendations regarding the SOQ may
be seen in Appendix G.
"In addition, the SOA is currently under revision to address the need to clearly define the"
requirements for the technical diplomas and to outline the graduation rate requirements to be placed
on local schools.
15
"During 2008, the Mathematics Standards of Learning are undergoing revision. In support of the"
"revisions, the outside groups—The College Board, ACT, and Achieve (through the American"
Diploma Project)—analyzed the alignment of Virginia’s Mathematics Standards of Learning with college
and workplace readiness benchmarks. This work has informed the review process and will increase
"the quality of Virginia’s mathematics standards. Also, the Board recently adopted revised Standards"
of Learning for the following subjects:
History and Social Science;
Physical Education;
Health Education; and
Driver Education.
"In addition, the Board adopted revised curriculum frameworks for History and Social Sciences and"
"for Algebra, Functions, and Data Analysis. The Board also adopted the World Class Instructional"
"Design Assessment ELP Standards of Learning, a move widely considered beneficial to local divisions"
and essential to keep Virginia’s standards consistent with best practice in the field.
"Virginia received a $500,000 grant from the National Governors Association (NGA) Center for Best"
"Practices to improve science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. The"
Board has been involved in two major activities under the grant: 1) the development of Governor’s
Career and Technical Academies and 2) the creation of the Governor’s Career and Technical
Education Exemplary Standards Awards Program. The Board of Education approved the Standards
for the Governor’s CTE Exemplary Awards Program in March 2008. The Board also approved the
criteria to establish a Governor’s Career and Technical Academy and approved the establishment of
the first Academies during the spring of 2008.
Objective 2: The Board of Education will provide leadership to help schools and school
divisions eliminate the achievement gap between groups of students and increase the
academic success of all students.
"As More Students Meet Proficiency Goals,"
More are Achieving at the Advanced Level
"As pass rates for student subgroups increase statewide, more students pass the"
"assessments at the proficient and advanced levels in all content areas. That is, our schools"
"are not only helping more students meet minimal proficiency goals, but also helping more"
students achieve at advanced levels.
"Achievement Gaps Still Persist, But are Narrowing"
"For Standards of Learning assessments, achievement gaps have narrowed for both"
"reading and mathematics, and the gaps in science and history and social science continue"
to narrow for Black and Hispanic students compared to their White peers.
Virginia’s schools are making progress on the persistent problem of gaps among groups of students
in achievement on statewide assessments. Virginia’s eighth grade Hispanic students had the highest

children need extra support to become proficient readers by the time they reach third grade.
Children identified as needing extra support then receive reading intervention services in part
through the state-funded Early Intervention Reading Initiative (EIRI).
"In the fall of 2006, 11 percent of the children who had attended VPI in the previous year were"
"identified as needing extra support to become proficient readers, compared to 17 percent of all"

Economically Disadvantaged Preschoolers Need Services
An October 2007 report from the Weldon Cooper Center at the University of Virginia
showed that 40 percent of Virginia’s four-year-olds who are economically disadvantaged do
not experience preschool—of any level of quality. This is true despite the fact that Virginia
has made significant increases in the number of school divisions and children participating in
VPI in recent years.

"An achievement gap is apparent in student graduation rates. There is a 9-, 11-, and 12-point",
"achievement gap for Black, Hispanic, and economically disadvantaged students, respectively,",
compared to the overall graduation rate.,
,21
"For the long run, however, results show a positive trend. Over the past three years, pass rates on"
statewide assessments have increased in nearly all grade levels and subjects tested tested. Pass rates
in reading range from a low of 83 percent in eighth grade to a high of 94 percent on end-of-course
"assessments. Over the same time period, pass rates on the statewide writing assessment have"
"declined in grades 5 and 8, and remained the same for two years on the end-of-course assessments."
"Writing assessment pass rates in grades five and eight are 87 percent, and 92 percent on the end-of-"
course assessment.
Virginia has a new initiative that will help parents select books that will strengthen their children’s
reading skills. When elementary and middle school students receive their Standards of Learning
"(SOL) test reports next spring and summer, their reading scores will be accompanied by a"
corresponding “Lexile measure” parents can use to select books. A Lexile measure ranks reading
"ability and text difficulty on a single scale, allowing parents — and teachers — to select books at or"
"slightly above a student’s reading level. Currently, more than 115,000 books have been assigned a"
Lexile measure. Adding Lexile measures to SOL reports also supports the Board’s objective of
increasing early reading skills and the Board of Education’s focus on improving adolescent literacy.
Objective 6: The Board of Education will establish policies and standards that enhance the
"preparation, recruitment, and retention of educational personnel, including their"
"meaningful, ongoing professional development."
New Virginia Standards for the Professional Practice of Teachers
The standards will assist teachers to reflect on student learning and teaching and to develop
professional development plans to improve teaching practice.
Standards for Teachers
"The Board adopted Virginia Standards for the Professional Practice of Teachers, a resource for the"
implementation of the Board of Education’s performance standards criteria. The standards represent
the knowledge and skills that are common to all teachers from pre-kindergarten through grade 12.
Teachers need to know what will be expected of them and how they will be evaluated. The
standards will assist teachers to reflect on student learning and teaching and to develop professional
development plans to improve teaching practice.
Recruiting and Retaining Excellent and Diverse Teachers
"Ninety-eight percent of all teachers are highly qualified, an increase from the previous year."
"Thirteen percent of teachers were Black and 2 percent were Hispanic, compared with"
"approximately 26 and 9 percent of students, respectively."
22
"Preparation, Recruitment, and Retention of Educational Personnel"
"Ninety-eight percent of all core academic teachers are highly qualified, an increase from the previous"
"year. In 2007-2008 the state retained 91 percent of the workforce from the previous year,"
representing a 2 percent increase from the previous year. The percent of teachers retained for 3
years remains at 82 percent.
Recruiting Minority Teachers
"In Virginia in 2007-2008, 13 percent of teachers were Black and 2 percent were Hispanic, compared"
"with approximately 26 and 9 percent of students, respectively."
Objective 7: The Board of Education will provide leadership in implementing the provisions of
state and federal laws and regulations.
One of the Board’s priorities is to fulfill its obligations to meet the requirements of state and federal
"laws and regulations, and to assist local divisions, where necessary, to do the same."
"The Board, through the work of its School and Division Level Accountability Committee, has"
kept its fingers on the pulse of the reauthorization status of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001.
"This has been a time-consuming task, but one that is critically important. While the Congress’"
"reauthorization moves have apparently now stalled for 2008, the Board continues to monitor the"
regulations and pending reauthorization closely and to advocate for the modifications and waivers
that it has requested of the U.S. Department of Education.
Keeping Regulations Up-to-Date
"During 2008, the Board of Education initiated or completed the adoption or repeal of 29 of"
its 62 current regulations. Most revisions are to ensure that new provisions in the Code of
Virginia are reflected in the Board’s regulations.
"During 2008, the Board of Education initiated or completed the adoption or repeal of 29 of its 62"
current regulations. Most revisions are to ensure that new provisions in the Code of Virginia are
reflected in the Board’s regulations. Major revisions were made to the Regulations Governing Special
Education Programs for Students with Disabilities in Virginia. The revisions were in response to the recent
federal reauthorization of the law and regulations governing programs for students with disabilities.
Objective 8: The Board of Education will provide leadership to help schools and school
divisions ensure a safe and secure environment conducive to facilitating the teaching and
learning process.
Abuse Prevention Programs are Widespread in Virginia’s Schools
A recent report from the Virginia Department of Education showed that the funds for these
programs supported drug prevention programs and activities in 98 percent of local divisions
and violence prevention programs and activities in 96 percent of divisions. Programs funded
"by this federal program were provided in a total 1,475 Virginia schools representing 79"
percent of Virginia schools.
23
"For a number of years, Virginia’s public schools have participated in the Safe and Drug-Free Schools"
and Communities Act programs. Federal funding for these programs goes directly to the schools
and the Virginia Department of Education provides extensive technical assistance for local
implementation of these programs. A recent report showed that the funds for these programs
supported drug prevention programs and activities in 98 percent of local divisions and violence
prevention programs and activities in 96 percent of divisions. Prevention services were provided in
"a total 1,475 Virginia schools representing 79 percent of Virginia schools."
Consistent with the central focus of the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities
"programming, the activity reported most frequently across elementary, middle, and high school"
levels was age-appropriate drug and violence prevention activities. Ranking second across all levels
was dissemination of drug and violence prevention information to schools and communities.
Compliance with the Requirements of the
Standards of Quality
Section 22.1-18 of the Code of Virginia requires the Board of Education to “identify any school
divisions and the specific schools therein which have failed to establish and maintain schools
meeting the existing prescribed standards of quality.”
Fifty-four divisions reported full compliance with the provisions of the Standards of Quality (SOQ)
in the 2007-2008 school year (listed in Appendix D). Appendix E contains a list of school divisions
that have reported non-compliance with any of the provisions of the SOQ. The appendix also
provides additional information on the status of compliance over the last three years for these
divisions.
"Each year, staff members of the Department of Education collect self-assessment data from school"
divisions on their compliance with the provisions of § 22.1-253.13:1 through 22.1-253.13:8 of the
Code of Virginia (Standards of Quality). The chairman of the school board and division
superintendent certify the level of compliance with the standards and the individual indicators within
each standard to the Department of Education via an electronic data collection system.
"Where divisions indicate less than full compliance with the standards, corrective action plans for the"
"noncompliance items are required. Of the divisions that were not in full compliance, all have filed a"
corrective action plan. The data are for the 2007-2008 school year and for the Standards of Quality
"that were in effect as of July 1, 2007."

student achievement. These schools — and areas of deficiency — are listed as follows:,
•,"A.P. Hill Elementary for English, mathematics and science"
•,"J.E.B. Stuart Elementary for English, mathematics, history and science"
•,"Peabody Middle for English, mathematics, history and science"
•,"Vernon Johns Middle for English, mathematics and history"
•,Petersburg High for mathematics and science
,25
Vernon Johns Middle was denied accreditation for a second consecutive year; the other Petersburg
schools listed are entering their third year without state accreditation. The 2006 memorandum of
understanding between Petersburg Public Schools and the Board of Education set a goal of full
accreditation for at least five of the division’s schools by 2008. With five of Petersburg’s seven
"schools denied accreditation, the state board requested that the Petersburg Public Schools move"
forward with a plan to provide an independently managed middle school program in 2009-2010 for
all students in the city who wish to attend.
Accredited with Warning
"The number of schools accredited with warning decreased to 54, compared with 102 last year."
"Eighty-three schools that were on academic warning last year achieved full accreditation, including"
"22 elementary schools, 52 middle schools, two high schools and seven combined schools. See"
Appendix F for a listing of all schools rated accredited with warning.
Conditional Accreditation
Twenty-three newly opened schools were automatically rated as conditionally accredited (new
schools) for 2008-2009.
"In addition, the Board of Education granted conditional accreditation to thirteen schools that have"
not met accreditation standards for four or more years. Schools that are granted conditional
accreditation have three years to raise student achievement to state standards and must apply
annually for this rating. These schools are working closely with the Virginia Department of
Education’s Office of School Improvement and are taking dramatic and meaningful actions to
improve instruction and raise student achievement to state standards. Additional information is
contained in Appendix F.
How Ratings are Determined
The accreditation ratings are based on the achievement of students on SOL assessments and
"approved substitute tests in English, mathematics, science, history and social science administered"
"during the summer and fall of 2007 and the spring of 2008, or on overall achievement during the"
"three most recent academic years. Also included are results of the Virginia Grade Level Assessment,"
"the Virginia Alternate Assessment Program, and the Virginia Substitute Evaluation Program. The"
results of tests administered in each subject area are combined to produce overall school passing
"percentages in English, mathematics, history and science."
"In middle schools and high schools, a pass rate of at least 70 percent in all four subject areas is"
"required for full accreditation. In elementary schools, a combined pass rate of at least 75 percent on"
English tests in grades 3-5 is required for full accreditation. Elementary schools also must achieve
"pass rates of at least 70 percent in mathematics, grade-5 science and grade-5 history, and pass rates"
of at least 50 percent in grade-3 science and grade-3 history.
Accreditation ratings may reflect adjustments made for schools that successfully remediate students
who failed reading or mathematics tests during the previous year. Adjustments also may be made for
students with limited-English proficiency and for students who have recently transferred into a
Virginia public school.

Percentage of Students Passing/Tested/Not Tested
"Schools, school divisions, and states are rated according to the progress toward the goals of the No"
Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB). This federal law requires states to set annual benchmarks for
achievement in reading and mathematics leading to 100 percent proficiency by 2014.
"Schools, school divisions, and states that meet or exceed all annual benchmarks toward this goal are"
"rated as having made adequate yearly progress (AYP). Schools, school divisions, states must test at"
"least 95 percent of students overall, and 95 percent of students in each of the following subgroups:"
"White, Black, Hispanic, students with disabilities, limited English proficient students, and students"
identified as disadvantaged. Annual accountability ratings are based on achievement during the
previous academic year or combined achievement from the three most recent years. Only student
subgroups represented are listed.
36
Assessment Results at each Proficiency Level by Subgroup
The Virginia Assessment Program includes Standards of Learning (SOL) tests and other statewide
"assessments in English, history/social science, mathematics, and science. The tables below provide"
"information for the three most recent years on the achievement of students on these tests, including"
percentages of students who demonstrate proficiency and advanced proficiency. Annual
accountability ratings are based on achievement during the previous academic year or combined
achievement from the three most recent years. Only student subgroups represented are listed.

"their average score was unchanged from 2002, and there was little change in proficiency levels."
"Ninety percent of Virginia students demonstrated at least basic writing skills on the 2007 test, and 31"
percent met or exceeded the rigorous NAEP standard for full proficiency.
"Black eighth grade students in Virginia achieved an average score of 142, compared with the national"

On-Time Graduation Rates
More than 81 percent of the students in the class of 2008 graduated on time with a diploma. The
"graduation rates for the commonwealth, school divisions and high schools were calculated for the"
first time by tracking individual students from year to year using the commonwealth’s longitudinal
"student data system. This new, more accurate statistic is known as the Virginia On-Time Graduation"
Rate.
The Virginia On-Time Graduation Rate is a cohort graduation rate that expresses the percentage of
students who earn a Board of Education-approved diploma within four years of entering ninth grade
for the first time. It is calculated using a formula endorsed in a 2005 compact signed by the nation’s
governors and subsequently adopted by the General Assembly and Board of Education.
Percentages are based on longitudinal student-level data and account for student mobility and
retention practices. Students with disabilities and English-language learners are counted as “on-time”
graduates even if they require more than the standard four years to earn a diploma.
"For a fifth consecutive year, the number of Virginia students graduating with an Advanced Studies"
Diploma increased and the number of advanced diplomas awarded exceeded the number of
Standard Diplomas.
"Of the 96,979 students in this year’s cohort, 78,805, or 81.3 percent, earned a Board of Education-"
"approved diploma. Of these on-time graduates, 41,888, or 53.2 percent, earned an Advanced Studies"
"Diploma; 33,151, or 42.1 percent, earned a Standard Diploma; 1,820, or 2.3 percent, earned a"
"Modified Standard Diploma; 1,930, or 2.4 percent, earned a Special Diploma; and 16 students"
earned a General Achievement Diploma. Modified Standard Diplomas and Special Diplomas are
available only to students with disabilities. General Achievement Diplomas are earned by overage
students.

"number to every student. This number, known as a “state testing identifier,” stays with the student",
throughout his or her PK-12 career.,

transfer to another school are subtracted. Division-level cohorts and the state-level cohort are,
adjusted in the same manner to account for student mobility.,

"Resources for Education, Virginia Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development,",
"Virginia Association of Elementary School Principals, Virginia Association of Secondary School",

"of 2003 in Richmond, Charlottesville, and Fairfax County. Finally, the Board held work sessions",
on April 30 and May 12 to deliberate on the various options that were proposed.,
,80
"Following the forum and public hearings, the Board of Education made the following"
recommendations to revise Standard Two of the Standards of Quality.
"Standard Two – Instructional, administrative, and support personnel."
2003 Board Recommendations:
• Require one full-time principal in each elementary school. [The SOQ currently requires a half-
time principal for elementary schools with fewer than 300 students.]
• Require one full-time assistant principal for each 400 students in each school. [The SOQ
currently requires one half-time assistant principal at an elementary school with between 600 and
899 students and one full-time assistant principal at an elementary school with 900 or more
students. The current middle and secondary assistant principal standard in the SOQ is for one
full-time assistant principal per 600 students in a school.]
"• Fund elementary resource teachers in art, music, and physical education. The proposal would"
"provide three periods per week for art, music, and physical education for students in grades K-5,"
assuming a 24:1 pupil-teacher ratio. This proposal translates into five instructional positions for
"every 1,000 students."
• Reduce the secondary school pupil to teacher funding ratio from 25:1 to 21:1 to support
scheduled planning time for secondary teachers.
• Reduce the state required speech language pathologist caseload from 68 to 60 students.
"• Fund two technology positions at 1 specialist per 1,000 students in grades K-12 division wide,"
"one to provide technology support, and one to serve as a resource teacher for instructional"
technology.
"• Require one full-time instructional position for each 1,000 students to serve as a reading"
specialist.
"• Revise the funding formula for the SOQ prevention, intervention, and remediation program."
The following recommended changes were enacted by the 2004 General Assembly in House Bills
1014 and Senate Bill 479:
"• Required local school boards to employ five positions per 1,000 students in grades kindergarten"
"through five to serve as elementary resource teachers in art, music, and physical education."
"(Effective July 1, 2005.)"
• Required local school boards to assign instructional personnel in a manner that produced
school wide ratios of students in average daily memberships to full-time equivalent teaching
positions of 21 to one in middle schools and high schools. School divisions were required to
"provide all middle and high school teachers with one planning period per day or the equivalent,"
"unencumbered of any teaching or supervisory duties. (Effective July 1, 2005.)"
"• Required local school boards to employ two positions per 1,000 students in grades kindergarten"
"through 12, one to provide technology support and one to serve as an instructional technology"
"resource teacher. (Effective July 1, 2005.)"
"• Established a funding formula for the prevention, intervention, and remediation program"
"proposed by the Board. (Effective July 1, 2004.) While the General Assembly passed the"
81
"legislation recommended by the Board, it did not recommend funding for four of the Board’s"
proposals. These included one full-time
principal in each elementary school; one full-time assistant principal for each 400 students in
each school; reduction of the state-required speech language pathologist caseload from 68 to 60
"students; and one full-time reading specialist for each 1,000 students."
The 2004 Appropriation Act passed by the General Assembly changed the required number of
"full-time equivalent instructional positions for each 1,000 students identified as having limited"
"English proficiency from 10 to 17, but no changes were made in the SOQ to reflect this language."
"In 2004, the Board recommended that the language in the SOQ be changed to comport with the"
"Appropriation Act requirement. Specifically, the Board recommended that “state funding, pursuant"
"to the appropriation act, shall be provided to support 17 full-time equivalent instructional positions"
"for each 1,000 students identified as having limited English proficiency.” This change was"
enacted by the 2005 General Assembly through House Bill 1762 and Senate Bill 779. The bills
also clarified provisions regarding the
"five positions per 1,000 students in kindergarten through grade five who serve as elementary"
"resource teachers in art, music, and physical education and the two positions per 1,000 students"
"in grades kindergarten through 12, one to provide technology support and one to serve as an"
"instructional technology resource teacher to be full-time equivalent positions. However, the 2005"
General Assembly did not appropriate the funding for the four unfunded positions that had been
proposed.
"In 2006, the Board began considering further changes to the Standards of Quality. On May 23,"
"2006, the Standards of Quality Committee of the Board of Education held a forum to hear"
comments from various organizations on potential changes to the Standards of Quality. Groups
"invited included the: Virginia Association of School Superintendents, Virginia School Boards"
Association and the Virginia School Board
"Association Limited English Proficiency Caucus, Virginia Education Association, Virginia"
"Association of Elementary School Principals, Virginia Association of Secondary School Principals,"
"Virginia Association of Supervision and Curriculum Development, Virginia Municipal League and"
Virginia Congress of Parents and Teachers.
"Additionally, between September 11 and September 27, 2006, the Board held ten public hearings"
"through Virginia and heard from 123 speakers. Following the forum and public hearings, the"
Board made the following staffing recommendations:
• Require one full-time principal in each elementary school. [The SOQ currently requires a half-
time principal for elementary schools with fewer than 300 students.]
• Require one full-time assistant principal for each 600 students in each school. [The SOQ
currently requires one half-time assistant principal at an elementary school with between 600 and
899 students and one full-time assistant principal at an elementary school with 900 or more
students. The current middle and secondary assistant principal standard in the SOQ is for one
full-time assistant principal per 600 students in a school.]
"• Require one full-time equivalent instructional position for each 1,000 students in average daily"
membership to serve as reading specialists for the school division.
• Require school boards to employ enough speech-language pathologists to ensure a caseload
that does not exceed 60 students per position.
"• Require one full-time equivalent instructional position for each 1,000 students in grades"
kindergarten through eight to serve as a mathematics specialist.

ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS: In addition to the positions supported by basic aid and
"those in support of regular school year programs of prevention, intervention, and remediation,"
"state funding, pursuant to the appropriation act, shall be provided to support 17 full-time"
"equivalent instructional positions for each 1,000 students identified as having limited English"
proficiency.
"The funding formula is as follows: 17 teachers per 1,000 English Language Learners multiplied by"
an average salary and fringe benefits. The product is adjusted by the composite index of local
ability-to-pay to determine state and local shares.
Increased accountability for LEP students as a result of the federal No Child Left Behind Act of
2001 require additional teacher resources to ensure that LEP students make annual gains in
developing English language proficiency and achieve success with the Standards of Learning.
States are required to report annual increases in the number or percentage of children attaining
English language proficiency as determined by an assessment of English language development
as well as the number of LEP students meeting adequate yearly progress on the SOL
assessments in English language and mathematics.
Information collected over the last year by the department has indicated that Virginia is one of a
handful of states with a defined staffing formula for English language learners.
"PRINCIPALS, ASSISTANT PRINCIPALS, LIBRARIANS, GUIDANCE COUNSELORS,"
"CLERICAL: Each local school board shall employ, at a minimum, the following full-time"
"equivalent positions for any school that reports fall membership, according to the type of school"
and student enrollment:
"Principals in elementary schools, one half-time to 299 students, one full-time at 300 students;"
"principals in middle schools, one full-time, to be employed on a 12-month basis; principals in high"
"schools, one full-time, to be employed on a 12-month basis;"
"Assistant principals in elementary schools, one half-time at 600 students, one full-time at 900"
"students; assistant principals in middle schools, one full-time for each 600 students; assistant"
"principals in high schools, one full-time for each 600 students;"
"Librarians in elementary schools, one part-time to 299 students, one full-time at 300 students;"
"librarians in middle schools, one-half time to 299 students, one full-time at 300 students, two full-"
"time at 1,000 students; librarians in high schools, one half-time to 299 students, one full-time at"
"300 students, two full-time at 1,000 students;"
"Guidance counselors in elementary schools, one hour per day per 100 students, one fulltime at"
"500 students, one hour per day additional time per 100 students or major fraction thereof;"
"guidance counselors in middle schools, one period per 80 students, one full-time at 400 students,"
one additional period per 80 students or major fraction thereof; guidance counselors in high
"schools, one period per 70 students, one full-time at 350 students, one additional period per 70"
students or major fraction thereof;
"Clerical personnel in elementary schools, part-time to 299 students, one full-time at 300 students;"
"clerical personnel in middle schools, one full-time and one additional full-time for each 600"
students beyond 200 students and one full-time for the library at 750 students; clerical personnel
"in high schools, one full-time and one additional full-time for each 600 students beyond 200"
students and one full-time for the library at 750 students.
This funding is also part of the Basic Aid calculation described above.
The SOQ currently requires a half-time principal for elementary schools with fewer than 300
students. The responsibilities of the principal are demanding and present significant challenges
85
for all schools and especially those elementary schools that do not have fulltime principals. In
"those school buildings without a principal or assistant principal, a common practice is to assign a"
"designee, usually a resource teacher, who must stop instructional lessons with students to deal"
with the many situations that arise on a daily basis. The SOQ currently requires one half-time
assistant principal at an elementary school with between 600 and 899 students and one full-time
assistant principal at an elementary school with 900 or more students. The current middle and
secondary assistant principal standard in the SOQ is for one full-time assistant principal per 600
students in a school. The demands and responsibilities of assistant principals have intensified
based on the increasing complexity of the principal’s role.
RESOURCE TEACHERS: Local school boards shall employ five full-time equivalent positions per
"1,000 students in grades kindergarten through five to serve as elementary resource teachers in"
"art, music, and physical education."
This funding is part of the Basic Aid calculation described above.
Studies show that participation in the arts and physical education may contribute to improved
student performance and increased achievement on test scores.
"The inclusion of art, music, and physical education is considered necessary for students’"
responsible participation in American society. The Standards of Accreditation (SOA) require the
"provision of instruction in art, music, and physical education and health for students at the"
"elementary, middle, and high school levels. Standard units of credit in health and physical"
education and in the fine or practical arts are included in the graduation requirements provided in
the SOA.
TECHNOLOGY POSITIONS: Local school boards shall employ two full-time equivalent positions
"per 1,000 students in grades kindergarten through 12, one to provide technology support and one"
to serve as an instructional technology resource teacher.
This funding is part of the Basic Aid calculation described above.
"As the availability and use of educational technology in schools has increased, it became evident"
that there is a growing need to provide personnel support for technical and instructional needs.
The Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission (JLARC) to recommend a state funding
formula for educational technology and technology support personnel. To integrate technology
"into instruction, an adequate system of support in schools is necessary. The purpose of the"
technology specialist position is to provide school-level technical assistance to teachers and
students in the use of technology. Technical support consists mainly of centralized and school-
"based support for information networks, such as selection, configuration, installation, operation,"
"repair, and maintenance. The Board of Education has approved Standards of Learning"
technology standards for K-12 students and technology standards for instructional personnel
(TSIP).
"SUPPORT COSTS: For the purposes of this title, unless the context otherwise requires, ""support"
"services"" shall include services provided by the school board members; the superintendent;"
"assistant superintendents; student services (including social workers, homebound, improvement,"
"and principal's office); attendance and health positions; administrative, technical, and clerical"
positions; operation and maintenance positions; technology support positions; school nurses; and
pupil transportation positions.
Support costs fall into the general categories of: 1) instructional professional support; 2) pupil
transportation; 3) attendance and health; 4) substitute teachers; 5) professional development; 6)
operations and maintenance; 7) superintendent and board member costs; and 8) facilities and
administration. These categories are funded in a formula that looks at actual expenditure and
position data as supplied by school divisions. The formula incorporates the costs in the general
86
"categories noted above for every school division and averages the costs, using a weighting"
system that recognizes and adjusts for reported costs that are unusually high or unusually low.
The product of the formula becomes the funding standard viewed as the prevailing support cost.
Prevailing support costs are included in Basic Aid. Both positions and non-salary support are
funded through this process.
This formula resulted from the review by the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission
(JLARC) in the 1980s.
OTHER SOQ FUNDED ITEMS:
SALES TAX: This funding component is not specifically identified in the Standards of Quality.
"However, the 1974 General Assembly, when it established the framework for the Standards of"
"Quality, included sales tax as one of four key funding elements. Sales tax distributed to school"
divisions represents the portion of net revenue from the state sales and use tax dedicated to
"public education (1 1/8%) that is distributed to counties, cities, and towns in support of the"
Standards of Quality.
Distribution is based upon each locality's pro-rata share of school age population as based on a
triennial school census. The formula works as follows: Triennial census count by school division
divided by the total triennial census count for the state multiplied by the estimate of the share of
state sales tax dedicated to public education (1 1/8%).
TEXTBOOKS: This funding component is not specifically identified in the Standards of Quality.
The practice of including textbooks in the Standards of Quality has been longstanding because of
the link to instructional services and because state law mandates that textbooks required for
instruction be provided free of charge.
State funding is provided on a per pupil basis based on the statewide prevailing per pupil cost of
textbooks incurred by school divisions. The formula works as follows: uniform statewide per pupil
amount multiplied by average daily membership to produce a total cost. This total cost is then
adjusted by the composite index of local ability-to-pay to yield the state and local shares.
FRINGE BENEFITS: This funding component is not specifically identified in the Standards of
"Quality. The practice of including fringe benefit costs (retirement, Social Security, group life,"
health care) has been longstanding because of the link to funding the salary/benefit cost of
instructional positions.
A unique per pupil amount per division is produced using actual cost data provided by the school
division. This per pupil amount is then multiplied by division-level average daily membership and
then adjusted for the composite index of local ability-to-pay to yield the state and local shares.

Appendix H:
2008 STANDARDS OF QUALITY AS AMENDED
§ 22.1-253.13:1. Standard 1. Instructional programs supporting the Standards of
Learning and other educational objectives.
A. The General Assembly and the Board of Education believe that the fundamental goal of the
public schools of this Commonwealth must be to enable each student to develop the skills that
"are necessary for success in school, preparation for life, and reaching their full potential. The"
General Assembly and the Board of Education find that the quality of education is dependent
"upon the provision of (i) the appropriate working environment, benefits, and salaries necessary to"
ensure the availability of high-quality instructional personnel; (ii) the appropriate learning
environment designed to promote student achievement; (iii) quality instruction that enables each
student to become a productive and educated citizen of Virginia and the United States of
"America; and (iv) the adequate commitment of other resources. In keeping with this goal, the"
"General Assembly shall provide for the support of public education as set forth in Article VIII,"
Section 1 of the Constitution of Virginia.
B. The Board of Education shall establish educational objectives known as the Standards of
"Learning, which shall form the core of Virginia's educational program, and other educational"
"objectives, which together are designed to ensure the development of the skills that are"
"necessary for success in school and for preparation for life in the years beyond. At a minimum,"
"the Board shall establish Standards of Learning for English, mathematics, science, and history"
and social science. The Standards of Learning shall not be construed to be regulations as defined
in § 2.2-4001.
The Board shall seek to ensure that the Standards of Learning are consistent with a high quality
"foundation educational program. The Standards of Learning shall include, but not be limited to,"
"the basic skills of communication (listening, speaking, reading, and writing); computation and"
critical reasoning including problem solving and decision making; proficiency in the use of
computers and related technology; and the skills to manage personal finances and to make
sound financial decisions.
The English Standards of Learning for reading in kindergarten through grade three shall be based
"on components of effective reading instruction, to include, at a minimum, phonemic awareness,"
"phonics, fluency, vocabulary development, and text comprehension."
The Standards of Learning in all subject areas shall be subject to regular review and revision to
maintain rigor and to reflect a balance between content knowledge and the application of
knowledge in preparation for eventual employment and lifelong learning.
"The Board of Education shall establish a regular schedule, in a manner it deems appropriate, for"
"the review, and revision as may be necessary, of the Standards of Learning in all subject areas."
Such review of each subject area shall occur at least once every seven years. Nothing in this
section shall be construed to prohibit the Board from conducting such review and revision on a
more frequent basis.
"To provide appropriate opportunity for input from the general public, teachers, and local school"
"boards, the Board of Education shall conduct public hearings prior to establishing revised"
"Standards of Learning. Thirty days prior to conducting such hearings, the Board shall give notice"
"of the date, time, and place of the hearings to all local school boards and any other persons"
requesting to be notified of the hearings and publish notice of its intention to revise the Standards
of Learning in the Virginia Register of Regulations.
Interested parties shall be given reasonable opportunity to be heard and present information prior
to final adoption of any revisions of the Standards of Learning.
89
"In addition, the Department of Education shall make available and maintain a website, either"
"separately or through an existing website utilized by the Department of Education, enabling public"
"elementary, middle, and high school educators to submit recommendations for improvements"
"relating to the Standards of Learning, when under review by the Board according to its"
"established schedule, and related assessments required by the Standards of Quality pursuant to"
this chapter. Such website shall facilitate the submission of recommendations by educators.
School boards shall implement the Standards of Learning or objectives specifically designed for
their school divisions that are equivalent to or exceed the Board's requirements. Students shall be
expected to achieve the educational objectives established by the school division at appropriate
age or grade levels. The curriculum adopted by the local school division shall be aligned to the
Standards of Learning.
The Board of Education shall include in the Standards of Learning for history and social science
"the study of contributions to society of diverse people. For the purposes of this subsection,"
"""diverse"" shall include consideration of disability, ethnicity, race, and gender."
"With such funds as are made available for this purpose, the Board shall regularly review and"
revise the competencies for career and technical education programs to require the full
"integration of English, mathematics, science, and history and social science Standards of"
Learning. Career and technical education programs shall be aligned with industry and
"professional standard certifications, where they exist."
C. Local school boards shall develop and implement a program of instruction for grades K
through 12 that is aligned to the Standards of Learning and meets or exceeds the requirements of
"the Board of Education. The program of instruction shall emphasize reading, writing, speaking,"
"mathematical concepts and computations, proficiency in the use of computers and related"
"technology, and scientific concepts and processes; essential skills and concepts of citizenship,"
"including knowledge of Virginia history and world and United States history, economics,"
"government, foreign languages, international cultures, health and physical education,"
environmental issues and geography necessary for responsible participation in American society
"and in the international community; fine arts, which may include, but need not be limited to, music"
"and art, and practical arts; knowledge and skills needed to qualify for further education, gainful"
"employment, or training in a career and technical field; and development of the ability to apply"
such skills and knowledge in preparation for eventual employment and lifelong learning and to
achieve economic self-sufficiency.
"Local school boards shall also develop and implement programs of prevention, intervention, or"
"remediation for students who are educationally at risk including, but not limited to, those who fail"
to achieve a passing score on any Standards of Learning assessment in grades three through
eight or who fail an end-of-course test required for the award of a verified unit of credit. Such
programs shall include components that are research-based.
"Any student who achieves a passing score on one or more, but not all, of the Standards of"
Learning assessments for the relevant grade level in grades three through eight may be required
to attend a remediation program.
Any student who fails to achieve a passing score on all of the Standards of Learning
assessments for the relevant grade level in grades three through eight or who fails an end-of-
course test required for the award of a verified unit of credit shall be required to attend a
remediation program or to participate in another form of remediation. Division superintendents
"shall require such students to take special programs of prevention, intervention, or remediation,"
"which may include attendance in public summer school programs, in accordance with clause (ii)"
of subsection A of § 22.1-254 and § 22.1-254.01.
90
"Remediation programs shall include, when applicable, a procedure for early identification of"
students who are at risk of failing the Standards of Learning assessments in grades three through
eight or who fail an end-of-course test required for the award of a verified unit of credit required
for the student's graduation. Such programs may also include summer school for all elementary
"and middle school grades and for all high school academic courses, as defined by regulations"
"promulgated by the Board of Education, or other forms of remediation. Summer school"
remediation programs or other forms of remediation shall be chosen by the division
superintendent to be appropriate to the academic needs of the student. Students who are
required to attend such summer school programs or to participate in another form of remediation
shall not be charged tuition by the school division.
"The requirement for remediation may, however, be satisfied by the student's attendance in a"
"program of prevention, intervention or remediation that has been selected by his parent, in"
"consultation with the division superintendent or his designee, and is either (i) conducted by an"
accredited private school or (ii) a special program that has been determined to be comparable to
the required public school remediation program by the division superintendent. The costs of such
private school remediation program or other special remediation program shall be borne by the
student's parent.
The Board of Education shall establish standards for full funding of summer remedial programs
"that shall include, but not be limited to, the minimum number of instructional hours or the"
equivalent thereof required for full funding and an assessment system designed to evaluate
program effectiveness. Based on the number of students attending and the Commonwealth's
"share of the per pupil instructional costs, state funds shall be provided for the full cost of summer"
"and other remediation programs as set forth in the appropriation act, provided such programs"
"comply with such standards as shall be established by the Board, pursuant to § 22.1-199.2."
D. Local school boards shall also implement the following:
1. Programs in grades K through three that emphasize developmentally appropriate learning to
enhance success.
"2. Programs based on prevention, intervention, or remediation designed to increase the number"
of students who earn a high school diploma and to prevent students from dropping out of school.
Such programs shall include components that are research-based.
3. Career and technical education programs incorporated into the K through 12 curricula that
include:
"a. Knowledge of careers and all types of employment opportunities including, but not limited to,"
"apprenticeships, entrepreneurship and small business ownership, the military, and the teaching"
"profession, and emphasize the advantages of completing school with marketable skills;"
b. Career exploration opportunities in the middle school grades; and
c. Competency-based career and technical education programs that integrate academic
"outcomes, career guidance and job-seeking skills for all secondary students. Programs must be"
based upon labor market needs and student interest. Career guidance shall include counseling
about available employment opportunities and placement services for students exiting school.
Each school board shall develop and implement a plan to ensure compliance with the provisions
of this subdivision. Such plan shall be developed with the input of area business and industry
representatives and local community colleges and shall be submitted to the Superintendent of
Public Instruction in accordance with the timelines established by federal law.
4. Early identification of students with disabilities and enrollment of such students in appropriate
instructional programs consistent with state and federal law.
5. Early identification of gifted students and enrollment of such students in appropriately
differentiated instructional programs.
6. Educational alternatives for students whose needs are not met in programs prescribed
elsewhere in these standards. Such students shall be counted in average daily membership
(ADM) in accordance with the regulations of the Board of Education.
91
7. Adult education programs for individuals functioning below the high school completion level.
Such programs may be conducted by the school board as the primary agency or through a
collaborative arrangement between the school board and other agencies.
8. A plan to make achievements for students who are educationally at risk a divisionwide priority
that shall include procedures for measuring the progress of such students.
9. A plan to notify students and their parents of the availability of dual enrollment and advanced
"placement classes, the International Baccalaureate Program, and Academic Year Governor's"
"School Programs, the qualifications for enrolling in such classes and programs, and the"
availability of financial assistance to low-income and needy students to take the advanced
placement and International Baccalaureate examinations.
10. Identification of students with limited English proficiency and enrollment of such students in
appropriate instructional programs.
"11. Early identification, diagnosis, and assistance for students with reading and mathematics"
problems and provision of instructional strategies and reading and mathematics practices that
benefit the development of reading and mathematics skills for all students.
"12. Incorporation of art, music, and physical education as a part of the instructional program at"
the elementary school level.
13. A program of physical fitness available to all students with a goal of at least 150 minutes per
week on average during the regular school year. Such program may include any combination of
"(i) physical education classes, (ii) extracurricular athletics, or (iii) other programs and physical"
activities deemed appropriate by the local school board.
Each local school board shall incorporate into its local wellness policy a goal for the
implementation of such program during the regular school year.
14. A program of student services for grades kindergarten through 12 that shall be designed to
"aid students in their educational, social, and career development."
15. The collection and analysis of data and the use of the results to evaluate and make decisions
about the instructional program.
"E. From such funds as may be appropriated or otherwise received for such purpose, there shall"
be established within the Department of Education a unit to (i) conduct evaluative studies; (ii)
provide the resources and technical assistance to increase the capacity for school divisions to
deliver quality instruction; and (iii) assist school divisions in implementing those programs and
practices that will enhance pupil academic performance and improve family and community
involvement in the public schools. Such unit shall identify and analyze effective instructional
programs and practices and professional development initiatives; evaluate the success of
programs encouraging parental and family involvement; assess changes in student outcomes
prompted by family involvement; and collect and disseminate among school divisions information
"regarding effective instructional programs and practices, initiatives promoting family and"
"community involvement, and potential funding and support sources. Such unit may also provide"
resources supporting professional development for administrators and teachers.
"In providing such information, resources, and other services to school divisions, the unit shall give"
priority to those divisions demonstrating a less than 70 percent passing rate on the Standards of
Learning assessments.
92
§ 22.1-253.13:4. Standard 4. Student achievement and graduation requirements.
"A. Each local school board shall award diplomas to all secondary school students, including"
"students who transfer from nonpublic schools or from home instruction, who earn the units of"
"credit prescribed by the Board of Education, pass the prescribed tests, and meet such other"
requirements as may be prescribed by the local school board and approved by the Board of
Education. Provisions shall be made to facilitate the transfer and appropriate grade placement of
"students from other public secondary schools, from nonpublic schools, or from home instruction"
as outlined in the standards for accreditation.
"Further, reasonable accommodation to meet the requirements for diplomas shall be provided for"
otherwise qualified students with disabilities as needed.
"In addition, each local school board may devise, vis-à-vis the award of diplomas to secondary"
"school students, a mechanism for calculating class rankings that takes into consideration whether"
the student has taken a required class more than one time and has had any prior earned grade
for such required class expunged.
Each local school board shall notify the parents of rising eleventh and twelfth grade students of (i)
the number and subject area requirements of standard and verified units of credit required for
graduation pursuant to the standards for accreditation and (ii) the remaining number and subject
area requirements of such units of credit the individual student requires for graduation.
B. Students identified as disabled who complete the requirements of their individualized
education programs shall be awarded special diplomas by local school boards.
Each local school board shall notify the parent of such students with disabilities who have an
individualized education program and who fail to meet the requirements for a standard or
"advanced studies diploma of the student's right to a free and appropriate education to age 21,"
"inclusive, pursuant to Article 2 (§ 22.1-213 et seq.) of Chapter 13 of this title."
C. Students who have completed a prescribed course of study as defined by the local school
board shall be awarded certificates of program completion by local school boards if they are not
"eligible to receive a standard, advanced studies, modified standard, special or general"
achievement diploma.
Each local school board shall provide notification of the right to a free public education for
"students who have not reached 20 years of age on or before August 1 of the school year,"
"pursuant to Chapter 1 (§ 22.1-1 et seq.) of this title, to the parent of students who fail to graduate"
or who have failed to achieve the number of verified units of credit required for graduation as
provided in the standards of accreditation. If such student who does not graduate or achieve such
"verified units of credit is a student for whom English is a second language, the local school board"
shall notify the parent of the student's opportunity for a free public education in accordance with §
22.1-5.
"D. In establishing course and credit requirements for a high school diploma, the Board shall:"
1. Provide for the selection of integrated learning courses meeting the Standards of Learning and
"approved by the Board to satisfy graduation credit requirements, which shall include Standards of"
"Learning testing, as necessary;"
"2. Establish the requirements for a standard, modified standard, or advanced studies high school"
"diploma, which shall include one credit in fine or performing arts or career and technical"
education and one credit in United States and Virginia history. The requirements for a standard
"high school diploma shall, however, include at least two sequential electives chosen from a"
concentration of courses selected from a variety of options that may be planned to ensure the
completion of a focused sequence of elective courses. Students may take such focused
sequence of elective courses in consecutive years or any two years of high school. Such focused
sequence of elective courses shall provide a foundation for further education or training or
93
"preparation for employment and shall be developed by the school division, consistent with Board"
of Education guidelines and as approved by the local school board;
3. Establish the requirements for a technical diploma. This diploma shall meet or exceed the
