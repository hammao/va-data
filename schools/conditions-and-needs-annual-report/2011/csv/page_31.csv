Actions to Meet the Goal
New Ways of Assessing Student Progress
Actions related to this goal are closely related to the actions for goal one. With the
"Board’s adoption of revised Standards of Learning in English, science, and mathematics,"
VDOE is developing new tests that will measure students’ mastery of the more rigorous
"content standards. The new mathematics, English, and science assessments will be"
"administered primarily online, and will include technology-enhanced items that require"
students to demonstrate content mastery in ways that were not possible with multiple-
"choice tests. The result of the standards revision, therefore, will be that students will"
"have to demonstrate mastery of more rigorous content in mathematics, English, and"
science in order to pass the revised SOL tests.
"In addition to the standards revisions, the Virginia Department of Education is"
developing the new tests to enable the Board to establish college ready achievement
levels on certain end-of-course assessments in English and mathematics. The Board is
considering proposals for minimum cut scores for the achievement levels of
pass/proficient and pass/advanced for the Algebra I and Geometry tests and
pass/proficient and pass/college path for the Algebra II test. These actions are part of the
Virginia College and Career Readiness Initiative. This action is intended to expand
"opportunities for students, such as dual enrollment."
Growth Measures
The Virginia Department of Education is also working to provide mathematics and
English teachers in tested grades with information about the growth of their students
"based on Standards of Learning test scores. Virginia’s growth measure, which is"
"currently under development, will provide teachers with information about the progress"
"of their students, relative to other students with similar achievement the previous year."
This information will help teachers and administrators understand how much progress
their students make each year. When used appropriately as one component of
"comprehensive performance evaluation, the growth measure can provide information"
about the contribution of teacher activities to student progress.
Requirements Will Become More Rigorous
Students will take more rigorous Standards of Learning mathematics tests beginning in
"2011-2012 and more rigorous tests in reading, writing, and science the following year."
"Taken together, these steps will represent a substantial increase in the rigor of Virginia’s"
accountability program. The accreditation ratings the Board and the Virginia Department
of Education will announce a year from now will mark a new beginning as schools
advance toward goals aligned with the latest national expectations for college and career
readiness.
