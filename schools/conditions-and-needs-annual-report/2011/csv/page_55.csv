"Throughout 2011, the Department of Education produced and implemented the"
"multidivision online provider application process, including the development of Criteria"
"for Approval of Multidivision Online Providers and the application, appeal, and"
"monitoring process. The application window was open for 30 days, beginning on"
"February 1, 2011. During that time, 14 organizations submitted applications and course"
"correlation documents. After a thorough review, 13 of these organizations were approved"
to offer online instruction as multidivision online providers. For the one rejected
"application, review teams noted significant deficiencies in policies, pupil performance"
"standards, Section 508 compliance, teacher licensure requirements, and correlation to the"
Standards of Learning.
Please see Appendix G for the full report on multidivision online providers.
Compliance with the Requirements of the
Standards of Quality
One hundred-four divisions reported full compliance with the provisions of the Standards
of Quality (SOQ) in the 2010-2011 school year. Appendices A and B contain
information and a list of school divisions that have reported noncompliance with any of
the provisions of the SOQ. The appendices also provide additional information on the
status of compliance over the last three years for these divisions.
"Where divisions indicate less than full compliance with the standards, corrective action"
plans for the noncompliance items are required. Of the divisions that were not in full
"compliance, all have filed a corrective action plan. The data are for the 2010-2011 school"
"year and for the Standards of Quality that were in effect as of July 1, 2010."
Appendix D contains a summary of the revisions to the Standards of Quality adopted by
"the 2011 General Assembly, and Appendix E contains the full text of the Standards of"
"Quality, effective July 1, 2011."
Compliance with the Requirements of the
Standards of Accreditation
"Ninety-six percent of Virginia’s 1,838 public schools are fully accredited and meeting all"
"state standards for achievement in English, mathematics, history and science — and"
"graduation, in the case of high schools. Ninety-eight percent of Virginia’s elementary"
schools and 97 percent of middle schools are fully accredited for the 2011-2012 school
"year, based on the performance of students on Standards of Learning (SOL) and other"
state assessments during 2010-2011. The percentage of fully accredited high schools
"dropped to 86 percent, compared with 99 percent last year, as the Board of Education"
introduced a “graduation and completion index” as a new accountability factor for high
"schools, in addition to student achievement on state tests. More detailed information is"
contained in Appendix C.
