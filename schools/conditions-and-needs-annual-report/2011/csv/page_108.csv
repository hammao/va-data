based on the Criteria for Approving Multidivision Online Providers. These teams will prepare a report with
recommendations for the Superintendent of Public Instruction within 30 business days of the close of the
application period.
The Superintendent of Public Instruction will make a decision regarding approval of multidivision online
providers and official notification of approval or notification of denial will be mailed to the applicant within
45 business days of the close of the application period. The letter will be sent by the U.S. Postal Service
and will include detailed reasons for denial if applicable.
Appeals Process for Multidivision Online Providers
"If the Superintendent of Public Instruction denies approval of an application, the applicant may submit a"
revised application within 30 business days of notification; the applicant is not required to submit a revised
application. The Superintendent of Public Instruction will review any changes and either approve or deny
the resubmitted application within 45 business days from the receipt of a resubmitted application.
"An applicant whose application has been denied by the Superintendent of Public Instruction, either upon"
"the original submission of the application or upon submission of a revised application, may appeal the"
decision of the Superintendent of Public Instruction to the Virginia Board of Education.
The appeal must be submitted to the Virginia Board of Education within 30 business days of the mailing of
the decision being appealed. The appeal must be in writing. The appeal shall contain: (1) a copy of the
decision being appealed; (2) the applicant’s statement of the errors alleged in the decision of the
Superintendent of Public Instruction; and (3) together with those portions of the application that bear on the
issues on appeal.
"The appeal to the Board is on the record, and the Board will not receive additional information, except for"
"good cause shown. “Good cause” means: (1) there is significant, relevant information not previously"
available and not presented to the Superintendent of Public Instruction; (2) there have been significant
changes in factors or circumstances relating to the application subsequent to the application being presented
"to the Superintendent; or (3) there is a substantial material mistake of fact or law in the application, and"
which could not have been avoided by diligence on the part of the applicant.
"Upon receipt of the appeal, the Board will convene to hear the matter; the meeting may be either a regularly"
"scheduled meeting of the Board, or upon a meeting called specially for the purpose. The Board delegates to"
the president the authority to issue such rulings and instructions as will ensure that the appeal is heard in a
"timely, efficient, and effective manner. The Board will render its decision in writing."
Denied applicants may also submit a new application in subsequent application periods.
Regular Monitoring of Multidivision Online Providers
An oversight committee of the Virginia Department of Education will conduct selected reviews of
approved providers and their approved courses each year. The intent of the regular monitoring process is to
provide oversight through periodic review of previously approved programs and to intervene when
"programs no longer meet the Criteria for Approving Multidivision Online Providers, including possible"
revocation of approved programs. Information from the reviews will be used in preparing an annual report
to the Governor and the General Assembly of Virginia.
"The applicant must submit a Provider Monitoring Report each year; however, the Virginia Department of"
Education may request that a Provider Monitoring Report be completed and submitted at any time.
Multidivision online providers must complete a full review after three years.
