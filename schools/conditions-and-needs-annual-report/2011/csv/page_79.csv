"of Education, each school board shall submit for approval by the Board a corrective action plan, consistent with criteria"
established by the Board and setting forth specific actions and a schedule designed to ensure that schools within its school
division achieve full accreditation status. Such corrective action plans shall be part of the relevant school division's
comprehensive plan pursuant to § 22.1-253.13:6.
"With such funds as are appropriated or otherwise received for this purpose, the Board shall adopt and implement an academic"
"review process, to be conducted by the Department of Education, to assist schools that are accredited with warning. The"
"Department shall forward a report of each academic review to the relevant local school board, and such school board shall report"
the results of such academic review and the required annual progress reports in public session. The local school board shall
implement any actions identified through the academic review and utilize them for improvement planning.
B. The Superintendent of Public Instruction shall develop and the Board of Education shall approve criteria for determining and
"recognizing educational performance in the Commonwealth's public school divisions and schools. Such criteria, when approved,"
shall become an integral part of the accreditation process and shall include student outcome measurements. The Superintendent
of Public Instruction shall annually identify to the Board those school divisions and schools that exceed or do not meet the
approved criteria. Such identification shall include an analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of public education programs in
the various school divisions in Virginia and recommendations to the General Assembly for further enhancing student learning
"uniformly across the Commonwealth. In recognizing educational performance in the school divisions, the Board shall include"
"consideration of special school division accomplishments, such as numbers of dual enrollments and students in Advanced"
"Placement and International Baccalaureate courses, and participation in academic year Governor's Schools."
The Superintendent of Public Instruction shall assist local school boards in the implementation of action plans for increasing
educational performance in those school divisions and schools that are identified as not meeting the approved criteria. The
Superintendent of Public Instruction shall monitor the implementation of and report to the Board of Education on the
effectiveness of the corrective actions taken to improve the educational performance in such school divisions and schools.
"C. With such funds as are available for this purpose, the Board of Education shall prescribe assessment methods to determine the"
"level of achievement of the Standards of Learning objectives by all students. Such assessments shall evaluate knowledge,"
"application of knowledge, critical thinking, and skills related to the Standards of Learning being assessed. The Board shall (i) in"
"consultation with the chairpersons of the eight regional superintendents' study groups, establish a timetable for administering the"
Standards of Learning assessments to ensure genuine end-of-course and end-of-grade testing and (ii) with the assistance of
"independent testing experts, conduct a regular analysis and validation process for these assessments."
"In prescribing such Standards of Learning assessments, the Board shall provide local school boards the option of administering"
"tests for United States History to 1877, United States History: 1877 to the Present, and Civics and Economics. The last"
administration of the cumulative grade eight history test will be during the 2007-2008 academic school year. Beginning with the
"2008-2009 academic year, all school divisions shall administer the United States History to 1877, United States History: 1877 to"
"the Present, and Civics and Economics tests. The Board shall also provide the option of industry certification and state licensure"
examinations as a student-selected verified credit.
The Board of Education shall make publicly available such assessments in a timely manner and as soon as practicable following
"the administration of such tests, so long as the release of such assessments does not compromise test security or deplete the bank"
"of assessment questions necessary to construct subsequent tests, or limit the ability to test students on demand and provide"
immediate results in the web-based assessment system.
The Board shall include in the student outcome measures that are required by the Standards for Accreditation end-of-course or
"end-of-grade tests for various grade levels and classes, as determined by the Board, in accordance with the Standards of Learning."
"These Standards of Learning assessments shall include, but need not be limited to, end-of-course or end-of-grade tests for"
"English, mathematics, science, and history and social science."
"In addition, to assess the educational progress of students, the Board of Education shall (i) develop appropriate assessments,"
which may include criterion-referenced tests and alternative assessment instruments that may be used by classroom teachers; (ii)
"select appropriate industry certification and state licensure examinations and (iii) prescribe and provide measures, which may"
include nationally normed tests to be used to identify students who score in the bottom quartile at selected grade levels. An
annual justification that includes evidence that the student meets the participation criteria defined by the Virginia Department of
Education shall be provided for each student considered for the Virginia Grade Level Alternative. Each Individual Education
Program team shall review such justification and make the final determination as to whether or not the Virginia Grade Level
Alternative is appropriate for the student. The superintendent and the school board chairman shall certify to the Board of
"Education, as a part of certifying compliance with the Standards of Quality, that there is a justification in the Individual"
Education Program for every student who takes the Virginia Grade Level Alternative. Compliance with this requirement shall be
monitored as a part of the special education monitoring process conducted by the Department of Education. The Board shall
report to the Governor and General Assembly in its annual reports pursuant to § 22.1-18 any school division that is not in
compliance with this requirement.
