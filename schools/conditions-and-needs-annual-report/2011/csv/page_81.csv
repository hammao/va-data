"H. Any school board, on behalf of one or more of its schools, may request the Board of Education for releases from state"
regulations and for approval of an Individual School Accreditation Plan for the evaluation of the performance of one or more of
its schools as authorized for certain other schools by the Standards of Accreditation pursuant to 8 VAC 20-131-280 C of the
Virginia Administrative Code.
§ 22.1-253.13:4. Standard 4. Student achievement and graduation requirements.
"A. Each local school board shall award diplomas to all secondary school students, including students who transfer from"
"nonpublic schools or from home instruction, who earn the units of credit prescribed by the Board of Education, pass the"
"prescribed tests, and meet such other requirements as may be prescribed by the local school board and approved by the Board of"
Education. Provisions shall be made to facilitate the transfer and appropriate grade placement of students from other public
"secondary schools, from nonpublic schools, or from home instruction as outlined in the standards for accreditation. Course credits"
earned for online courses taken in the Department of Education's Virtual Virginia program shall transfer to Virginia public
"schools in accordance with provisions of the standards for accreditation. Further, reasonable accommodation to meet the"
requirements for diplomas shall be provided for otherwise qualified students with disabilities as needed.
"In addition, each local school board may devise, vis-a-vis the award of diplomas to secondary school students, a mechanism for"
calculating class rankings that takes into consideration whether the student has taken a required class more than one time and has
had any prior earned grade for such required class expunged.
Each local school board shall notify the parents of rising eleventh and twelfth grade students of (i) the number and subject area
requirements of standard and verified units of credit required for graduation pursuant to the standards for accreditation and (ii)
the remaining number and subject area requirements of such units of credit the individual student requires for graduation.
B. Students identified as disabled who complete the requirements of their individualized education programs shall be awarded
special diplomas by local school boards.
Each local school board shall notify the parent of such students with disabilities who have an individualized education program
and who fail to meet the requirements for a standard or advanced studies diploma of the student's right to a free and appropriate
"education to age 21, inclusive, pursuant to Article 2 (§ 22.1-213 et seq.) of Chapter 13 of this title."
C. Students who have completed a prescribed course of study as defined by the local school board shall be awarded certificates of
"program completion by local school boards if they are not eligible to receive a standard, advanced studies, modified standard,"
"special, or general achievement diploma."
Each local school board shall provide notification of the right to a free public education for students who have not reached 20
"years of age on or before August 1 of the school year, pursuant to Chapter 1 (§ 22.1-1 et seq.) of this title, to the parent of"
students who fail to graduate or who have failed to achieve the number of verified units of credit required for graduation as
provided in the standards for accreditation. If such student who does not graduate or achieve such verified units of credit is a
"student for whom English is a second language, the local school board shall notify the parent of the student's opportunity for a"
free public education in accordance with § 22.1-5.
"D. In establishing course and credit requirements for a high school diploma, the Board shall:"
1. Provide for the selection of integrated learning courses meeting the Standards of Learning and approved by the Board to satisfy
"graduation credit requirements, which shall include Standards of Learning testing, as necessary."
"2. Establish the requirements for a standard, modified standard, or advanced studies high school diploma, which shall include one"
credit in fine or performing arts or career and technical education and one credit in United States and Virginia history. The
"requirements for a standard high school diploma shall, however, include at least two sequential electives chosen from a"
concentration of courses selected from a variety of options that may be planned to ensure the completion of a focused sequence
of elective courses. Students may take such focused sequence of elective courses in consecutive years or any two years of high
school. Such focused sequence of elective courses shall provide a foundation for further education or training or preparation for
"employment, shall be identified in the Academic and Career Plan as described in Board of Education regulations, and shall be"
"developed by the school division, consistent with Board of Education guidelines and as approved by the local school board."
3. Establish the requirements for a technical diploma. This diploma shall meet or exceed the requirements of a standard diploma
"and will include a concentration in career and technical education, as established in Board regulations. A student who meets the"
requirement for the advanced studies diploma who also fulfills a concentration in career and technical education shall receive an
"advanced technical diploma, or if he chooses, he shall receive an advanced studies diploma. The Board may develop or designate"
assessments in career and technical education for the purposes of awarding verified credit pursuant to subdivision 6.
"4. Provide, in the requirements for the verified units of credit stipulated for obtaining the standard or advanced studies diploma,"
that students completing elective classes into which the Standards of Learning for any required course have been integrated may
