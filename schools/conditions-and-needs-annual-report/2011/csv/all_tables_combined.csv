Major Actions to Implement Policies for Goal 2:
"New Ways of Assessing Student Progress: New mathematics, English, and science assessments will be administered primarily"
"online, and will include technology-enhanced items that require students to demonstrate content mastery in ways that were not"
"possible with multiple-choice tests, enabling the Board to establish new and challenging cut scores as a part of the Virginia"
College and Career Readiness Initiative.
"Growth Measures: Virginia’s growth measure, currently under development, will provide information about student progress"
relative to other students with similar achievement the previous year.
Requirements Will Become More Rigorous: Students will take more rigorous Standards of Learning mathematics tests
"beginning in 2011-2012 and more rigorous tests in reading, writing, and science the following year."
What the Data Showed:
Important National Comparisons: Results from the 2011 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) show that
Virginia public school students continue to rank among the nation’s highest achievers in reading and mathematics and
"outperform their peers nationwide, and Virginia now ranks among the top on Advanced Placement Results. Virginia now"
ranks third in the nation in achievement on Advanced Placement (AP) examinations. Only Maryland and New York had
"higher percentages. Nonetheless, disparities among subgroups remain. For example, NAEP results show that that black and"
Hispanic students trail their white peers by more than 22 test-score points on the reading assessments at 4th and 8th
"grades. In mathematics, NAEP results at the 4th and 8th grades show, respectively, a 22- and 29- test-score point"
difference between black students and their white peers.
"Students Earning Industry Credentials Increased: In 2011, students passed more than 36,000 industry certification,"
"occupational competency, or workplace readiness exams, or achieved state licensure in areas eligible for student-selected"
certified credits.
The Needs of Public Schools: What Remains to be Done To Accomplish Goal 2?
Raising the Rigor of Virginia’s Academic Standards: Virginia's fourth- and eighth-graders perform better in reading and
"mathematics than their peers nationwide; however, less than two-fifths have a solid grasp of reading and less than half have a"
solid grasp of mathematics based on NAEP’s definition of proficiency.
"As schools implement more rigorous standards and tests in English and mathematics, starting with mathematics this year and"
"followed by English during 2012-2013, there may be further declines in accreditation. As more rigorous standards and"
"assessments become effective, a new trend line will begin, but we must not become alarmed or discouraged. We must not give"
into temptation to preserve the status quo. Raising standards is the right thing to do and our teachers and schools will rise to
the challenge and Virginia students will be better prepared as a result.
Virginia and the Nation: Far Behind in International Comparisons: Studies suggest that for Virginia and the nation to remain
"competitive in the global economy, the U.S. is going to need to make substantial gains in mathematics and science"
achievement.
"Eliminating Achievement Gaps: Persistent achievement gaps show up in on-time graduation rates, dropout rates, Standards"
"of Learning test performance, NAEP, SAT, Advanced Studies diploma rates."

Goal 4: Strong Literacy and Mathematics Skills
The Board of Education will establish policies that support the attainment of literacy and mathematics skills for all
"students, pre-K through grade 12."
Major Policy Decisions to Address Goal 4:
The Board’s policy actions include revising Virginia’s textbook review process; adopting the process for state approval
of textbooks for K-12 English/Language Arts and K-12 Science; adopting the list of state-approved textbooks for K-12
mathematics; adopting Guidelines for Local Textbook Approval; and reaffirming its support for College and Career
Ready Standard.
Actions to Meet the Goal:
College and Career Readiness Initiative (CCRI): The Virginia College and Career Readiness Initiative builds on the
"revised standards and is designed to: a) ensure that college and career ready learning standards in reading, writing, and"
mathematics are taught in every Virginia high school classroom; and b) strengthen students’ preparation for college
and the work force before leaving high school.
Virginia Index of Performance: The recent revision made by the Board added components that provide additional
incentives for school divisions and schools to promote student achievement in the STEM areas and college and career
readiness in general. The revisions also increased the importance of foreign language instruction in elementary
schools.
"Textbook Review and Selection Procedures: In 2011, the Virginia Board of Education approved a revised and"
strengthened textbook approval process. The new process places primary responsibility on publishers to ensure the
accuracy of their textbooks. It is the Board’s intent to incorporate the procedures to regulations as soon as possible.
Helping Students Meet Academic Standards: Current programs that have helped students meet and exceed existing
standards include the Virginia Preschool Initiative; K-3 Class Size Reduction; At-Risk Add-on; SOQ English as a
Second Language programs; Early Intervention Reading Initiative; the Algebra Readiness Initiative; Project
"Graduation; Remedial Summer School; SOQ Prevention, Intervention, and Remediation; and the Regional Alternative"
Education Programs.
What the Data Show:
Increased Rigor: The most recent SOL revisions (2009 and 2010) led to more rigorous content standards that are
"supported as college and career ready by nationally recognized organizations, the College Board, ACT, and Achieve."
New end-of-course mathematics assessments will be implemented in 2011-2012 and new reading and writing
"assessments will be implemented in 2012-2013. The new assessments will be administered online, and include"
technology-enhanced items that require students to demonstrate content mastery in ways that were not possible with
multiple-choice tests.
Increased Proficiency in Mathematics: The percentage of grade-8 students who met or exceeded the rigorous NAEP
"standard for proficiency increased by a statistically significant four points to 40 percent in 2011, compared with 36"
percent in 2009 when the national tests were last administered. Forty-six percent of Virginia fourth-grade students
scored proficient or above in mathematics — six points higher than the percentage nationwide and a three-point
increase since 2009.
What Remains to be Done to Accomplish Goal 4:
"For the College and Career Ready Initiative to be successful, educators must have access to and participate in"
appropriate professional development. The Virginia Department of Education has identified existing funds that allow
the agency to work with our partners—such as institutions of higher education—to develop and implement high
quality professional development to support local educators and to implement the revised mathematics and English
"Standards of Learning. In the next few years, as new resources are limited, continued emphasis on programs for at-risk"
"students will be even more critical for Virginia’s students, as the more rigorous standards are put in place and tested."
"As schools implement more rigorous standards and tests in English and mathematics, starting with mathematics this"
"year and followed by English during 2012-2013, there may be further declines in accreditation."

Goal 7: Safe and Secure Schools
The Board of Education will provide leadership to create safe and secure school environments.
Major Policy Decisions to Address Goal 7:
"Policy actions include policies on Guidelines for Policies on Concussions in Student-Athletes, Guidelines for the"
"Prevention of Sexual Misconduct and Abuse in Virginia Public Schools, and Elementary School Gun Safety Guidelines"
and Curriculum. Policy actions also include continuing to support Bullying Prevention programs and examination of
data on effective discipline initiatives.
Actions to Meet the Goal:
Guidelines for Interactions between Students and Teachers: The Board of Education adopted Guidelines for the
Prevention of Sexual Misconduct and Abuse in Virginia Public Schools to help school divisions create and implement
"policies and procedures that establish clear and reasonable boundaries for interactions between students and teachers,"
"other school board employees, and adult volunteers."
"Policies on Student-Athlete Concussions: On the student health front, the Board of Education worked with the state’s"
health care leaders and other interested stakeholders to develop guidelines for concussions in student-athletes.
Cyberbullying: The Virginia Department of Education has provided its own research and resources by focusing on the
"use of online, interactive, story-based lessons on various Internet safety issues, including cyberbullying. The resulting"
"research demonstrated that these lessons had a positive impact on the behavior of fourth-grade students. Subsequently,"
this project has been continued using Garfield characters and created in cooperation with the Professor Garfield
Foundation.
The Board has expressed its interest in a discipline program called Effective Schoolwide Discipline as a proven
"effective way to not only improve student behavior, but also to improve academic performance."
What the Data Show:
"Incidents of Crime and Violence in Public Schools Drop: In 2009-2010, there were 41,913 fewer required reporting"
incidents than reported in 2008-2009. Comparison of the most frequently reported incidents shows a decline in
"incidents of attendance, classroom/campus disruption, disrespect, other school violations, bullying, obscene"
"language/gestures, and minor insubordinations. Incidents that show an increase were incidents of defiance, cellular"
"phones, inappropriate personal property, possession of obscene/disruptive literature, and drug use possession or"
sales/distribution of Schedule I or II.
What Remains to be Done to Accomplish Goal 7:
A high priority for the Board is dealing effectively with the realities of schooling for some children who face difficult
"personal circumstances such as high poverty, high crime in their neighborhoods, high rates of unhealthy behaviors,"
"poor nutrition, and other circumstances that obstruct their learning at school. The Board must continue to stress the"
"importance of successful, communitywide partnerships in the development of procedures and policies that most"
"effectively support healthy, safe, orderly and disciplined school environments."
"As more and more research in Internet safety shows, it is clear that bullying behavior and cyberbullying are among the"
most pressing issues involved in keeping public schools and the children in them safe.
"Integral to safe and healthy school environments is parent and family involvement. To do this, schools need to"
promote and enhance cooperative partnerships in which families are allies in the efforts of teachers and schools.

Closing Statement by the Virginia Board of Education
The condition and needs of Virginia’s public schools described in this report should be
viewed as guideposts for action. The information in this report points toward critical
areas of need that will undermine Virginia’s future success if not addressed quickly and
effectively. Public education benefits everyone. It is the key to ensuring quality of life
and economic prosperity for Virginia’s citizens both now and in the future.
The encouraging progress made by Virginia’s schools and students should not mask the
realities of schooling for some children who may face difficult personal circumstances
"such as high poverty, high crime in their neighborhoods, and other circumstances that"
"obstruct their learning at school. Moreover, the condition and needs of schools surely"
reflect the condition and needs found in their communities. While the achievement gaps
"that exist among groups of students are narrowing, the gaps persist and provide a huge"
challenge to our public schools.
Raising the rigor of Virginia’s academic standards is a challenge faced by the Board of
Education in its drive to focus on college and career readiness standards that are
internationally competitive. As schools implement more rigorous standards and tests in
"English and mathematics, there may be further declines in accreditation. We must not"
become alarmed or discouraged. We must not give into temptation to preserve the status
quo. Raising standards is the right thing to do and our teachers and schools will rise to the
challenge and Virginia students will be better prepared as a result.
The Board of Education is bold in its expectations and the actions taken as a result. It also
acknowledges the challenges our students will face as they grow into productive adult
"citizens of the global economy—the rapid growth in technology, the changing"
"demographics of our communities, and greater demands for skills for all citizens."
"With its comprehensive plan of action as its roadmap, the Board of Education’s"
overarching goal is for all of Virginia’s public school graduates to be college and career
ready.

Public Schools in Virginia
The Board’s Goals: Meeting the Critical Needs of Virginia’s Public Schools
The Board of Education has adopted a comprehensive plan of action for the coming
years. The comprehensive plan outlines the seven goals shown in the following pages.
The goals were set by the Board to address the complex needs and challenges that impact
our schools and our young people. More details on the Board of Education’s
"Comprehensive Plan: 2011-2016, may be viewed at:"
http://www.doe.virginia.gov/VDOE/VA_Board/comprehensiveplan.pdf.
The following pages contain an assessment of the Board’s policy decisions to address
"each of its goals. For each goal, highlights of data to assess the results of recent policy"
decisions and a brief description of the areas that need continued attention are shown.
Goal 1: Expanded Opportunities to Learn: The Board of Education will continue to improve the
standards for public schools in Virginia in order to expand learning opportunities needed for Virginia’s
public schools. Our schools will lead the nation in rigor and quality and our students will compete and
excel in postsecondary education and/or in the global workplace.
Goal 2: Accountability of Student Learning: The Board of Education will support accountability for
all public schools by providing leadership and by establishing policies that help schools and school
"divisions increase the academic success of all students, especially those who are at-risk or in"
"underperforming school systems. Using improved longitudinal data systems, the Board will monitor"
schools’ progress in closing achievement gaps among groups of students.
Goal 3: Nurturing Young Learners: The Board of Education will work cooperatively with partners
and will promote new and innovative partnerships to help ensure that all young children are ready to
enter kindergarten with the skills they need for success.
Goal 4: Strong Literacy and Mathematics Skills: The Board of Education will establish policies that
"support the attainment of literacy and mathematics skills for all students, pre-K through grade 12."
Goal 5: Highly Qualified and Effective Teachers and Administrators: The Board of Education will
"establish policies and standards that improve the preparation, recruitment, and retention of Virginia’s"
"educational personnel, including meaningful and ongoing professional development, especially in"
teacher shortage areas and in hard-to-staff schools.
Goal 6: Sound Policies for Student Success: The Board of Education will provide leadership to
develop and implement the provisions of state and federal laws and regulations in ways that improve
and expand opportunities for all of Virginia’s schoolchildren to excel academically.
Goal 7: Safe and Secure Schools: The Board of Education will provide leadership to create safe and
secure school environments.

"approved by the Board during the past year, the Department of Education produced and"
"implemented the multidivision online provider application process, including the"
development of Criteria for Approval of Multidivision Online Providers and the
"application, appeal, and monitoring process (see Appendix G)."
Fourteen organizations submitted applications and course correlation documents. After a
"thorough review, 13 of these organizations were approved to offer online instruction as"
"multidivision online providers. For the one rejected application, review teams noted"
"significant deficiencies in policy, pupil performance standards, Section 508 compliance,"
"teacher licensure requirements, and correlation to the SOL."
Reviewing and Updating Standards of Quality
"The Board of Education regularly reviews and revises the Standards of Quality (SOQ),"
"Standards of Accreditation (SOA), and Standards of Learning (SOL). Throughout this"
"process, the Board collects data and information that support its ability to thoughtfully"
and deliberately make revisions that are designed to enhance the quality of the standards
to which Virginia’s students are held.
"In 2011, the Board of Education recommended that flexibility be given to divisions to use"
funds provided in the appropriation act for certain staffing standards related to
"instructional staff in mathematics, limited English proficiency, reading, technology and"
assistant principals. The Board also recommended clarification of the term “support
services.” The Board’s recommendations were subsequently adopted by the 2011 General
Assembly.
Performance Measures for Goal 1: What the Data Show
On-Time Graduation Rate
"Virginia’s on-time high school graduation rate rose one point this year to 86.6 percent,"
and the statewide dropout rate fell 0.6 percent to 7.2 percent. On-time graduation has
"increased by 4.5 points since 2008, the first year the Virginia Department of Education"
"(VDOE) reported graduation rates for the state, school divisions and high schools based"
"on student-level data that fully account for student mobility, promotion and retention. A"
"one-point increase in the graduation rate means that nearly 1,000 more young Virginians"
are beginning their adult lives with the diploma they need to pursue further education and
training or an entry-level job.
"Virginia’s federal graduation indicator, which just includes the Standard and Advanced"
"Studies Diploma, rose 1.7 percent to 81.6 percent for all students. Additional information"
on graduation rates may be viewed in Appendix H.
High schools must now meet an annual benchmark for graduation and completion to earn
full accreditation under Virginia's Standards of Learning (SOL) accountability program.
Schools receive full credit for students who earn diplomas and partial credit for students
"who remain enrolled, earn GEDs or otherwise complete high school. The ratings"
announced last month were the first to include this new accountability factor for high
schools.
2011 Annual Report on Condition and Needs of Public Schools
Page 25
"New data for the class of 2010 show that 1,176 students returned for a fifth year of high"
school and earned diplomas. Their achievement resulted in a five-year graduation rate for
"the class of 2010 of 87 percent compared with a four-year, on-time rate of 85.5 percent."
Gap in Graduation Rate for Student Subgroups: Improving But Persistent
"In 2011 compared to 2010, the rate for black students increased 1.4 points to 80.3"
"percent, and on-time graduation for Hispanic students increased 3 points to 79.1 percent."
"The on-time graduation rate for black students has risen 6.3 points, and the rate for"
"Hispanic students has risen by 7.9 points since 2008, the first year cohort graduation rates"
"were reported. For economically disadvantaged students, the rate has risen by 9.3 percent"
during that time period.
"Nonetheless, a gap in the graduation rate of subgroups of students is a problem that has"
"persisted in time, as shown in the following table. Economically disadvantaged students"
and minority students are less likely than all students to graduate in four years. There is a
"6-, 7-, and 6-point achievement gap for black, Hispanic, and economically disadvantaged"
"students, respectively, compared to the overall graduation rate."

,Goal 2: Accountability of Student Learning
,The Board of Education will support accountability for all public
,schools by providing leadership and by establishing policies that
,help schools and school divisions increase the academic success of
,"all students, especially those who are at-risk or in underperforming"
,"school systems. Using improved longitudinal data systems, the"
,Board will monitor schools’ progress in closing achievement gaps
,among groups of students.

Actions to Meet the Goal
New Ways of Assessing Student Progress
Actions related to this goal are closely related to the actions for goal one. With the
"Board’s adoption of revised Standards of Learning in English, science, and mathematics,"
VDOE is developing new tests that will measure students’ mastery of the more rigorous
"content standards. The new mathematics, English, and science assessments will be"
"administered primarily online, and will include technology-enhanced items that require"
students to demonstrate content mastery in ways that were not possible with multiple-
"choice tests. The result of the standards revision, therefore, will be that students will"
"have to demonstrate mastery of more rigorous content in mathematics, English, and"
science in order to pass the revised SOL tests.
"In addition to the standards revisions, the Virginia Department of Education is"
developing the new tests to enable the Board to establish college ready achievement
levels on certain end-of-course assessments in English and mathematics. The Board is
considering proposals for minimum cut scores for the achievement levels of
pass/proficient and pass/advanced for the Algebra I and Geometry tests and
pass/proficient and pass/college path for the Algebra II test. These actions are part of the
Virginia College and Career Readiness Initiative. This action is intended to expand
"opportunities for students, such as dual enrollment."
Growth Measures
The Virginia Department of Education is also working to provide mathematics and
English teachers in tested grades with information about the growth of their students
"based on Standards of Learning test scores. Virginia’s growth measure, which is"
"currently under development, will provide teachers with information about the progress"
"of their students, relative to other students with similar achievement the previous year."
This information will help teachers and administrators understand how much progress
their students make each year. When used appropriately as one component of
"comprehensive performance evaluation, the growth measure can provide information"
about the contribution of teacher activities to student progress.
Requirements Will Become More Rigorous
Students will take more rigorous Standards of Learning mathematics tests beginning in
"2011-2012 and more rigorous tests in reading, writing, and science the following year."
"Taken together, these steps will represent a substantial increase in the rigor of Virginia’s"
accountability program. The accreditation ratings the Board and the Virginia Department
of Education will announce a year from now will mark a new beginning as schools
advance toward goals aligned with the latest national expectations for college and career
readiness.

Performance Measures for Goal 4: What the Data Show
"The CCRI builds on 15 years of establishing, implementing, and revising learning"
standards and assessment-based accountability. Rigorous content standards were
"developed and implemented in the 1990s; tests are in place for mathematics, English,"
"science, and history and social science. The Board of Education revised the mathematics"
and English standards twice since implementation. The most recent revisions (2009 and
2010) led to more rigorous content standards that are supported as college and career
"ready by nationally recognized organizations, the College Board, ACT, and Achieve."
"In addition to increased rigor, we also see more middle school students enrolled in"
Algebra I or higher courses. This year the percent of middle school students enrolled in
"Algebra I or higher was 48.8 percent of students, an increase of 3.9 percent from 2009-"
"2010, and a 9.4 percent increase over the last three years."
Virginia is developing new SOL assessments that align to the revised mathematics and
"English Standards of Learning adopted in 2009 and 2010, respectively. New end-of-"
course mathematics assessments will be implemented in 2011-2012 and new reading and
writing assessments will be implemented in 2012-2013. The new assessments will be
"administered online, and include technology-enhanced items that require students to"
demonstrate content mastery in ways that were not possible with multiple-choice tests.
The result of the standards revision will be that students will have to demonstrate mastery
"of more rigorous content in order to pass the revised SOL tests. On relevant tests, the"
college ready score will replace the current advanced proficient score.
The Needs of Public Schools:
What Remains to be Done to Accomplish Goal 4
"For the CCRI to be successful, educators must have access to and participate in"
appropriate professional development. The Virginia Department of Education has
identified existing funds that allow the agency to work with our partners—such as
institutions of higher education—to develop and implement high quality professional
development to support local educators and to implement the revised mathematics and
English Standards of Learning.
"In the next few years, as new resources are limited, continued emphasis on programs for"
"at-risk students will be even more critical for Virginia’s students, as the more rigorous"
standards are put in place and tested.

The Needs of Public Schools:
What Remains to be Done to Accomplish Goal 6
Develop Realistic Accountability Model
"The need to comply with federal laws, programs, rules, and regulations has led to a"
significant strain on fiscal and staff resources at the state and local levels. Virginia needs
a new model for measuring yearly progress that maintains high expectations for student
"achievement, recognizes growth — overall and by subgroup — and accurately identifies"
schools most in need of improvement.
"In his August 24, 2011, letter to U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, Governor"
McDonnell pointed out the flaws of NCLB and noted that “A model that increasingly
misidentifies schools as low performing and confuses the public about the quality of their
schools does not advance the cause of reform or accountability.” The prescriptive nature
"of the law, most visible in provisions such as Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) and the"
"requirement for all children to be proficient in mathematics and reading by the year 2014,"
"has led to some serious unintended consequences. Only 38 percent of Virginia’s 1,838"
"schools made AYP based on results from the 2010-2011 assessments, compared to 61"
percent of schools that made AYP in the previous year. Only four of Virginia’s 132
"divisions made AYP based on 2010-2011 assessments, compared with 12 divisions that"
made AYP in the previous year. The AYP targets were five points higher (86 percent) in
reading and six points higher in mathematics (85 percent) than the targets for assessments
"taken by students during 2009-2010. As a consequence, 342 schools that made AYP in"
"the previous year, and would have made AYP had the targets not increased, were"
identified as not making AYP.
The number of schools making AYP dropped even though achievement levels on state
tests were little changed during 2010-2011. There are schools that did not make AYP in
"which achievement in reading and mathematics actually increased, but not by enough to"
keep up with the benchmarks. With AYP targets scheduled to increase an additional five
"points in both reading and mathematics for the 2012 assessment cycle, it is anticipated"
that an even greater disproportionate percentage of schools and divisions will be
misidentified as underperforming during the 2012-2013 year. The public is
understandably confused and frustrated by this misleading and unrealistic model of
accountability.
"Raising student achievement is a priority that overrides fiscal difficulties. Virginia, as"
"with most states, is experiencing unprecedented fiscal challenges at both the state and"
"local levels. While funding adequacy and equity must remain a priority, ensuring that"
limited resources are used as effectively as possible is paramount.
Fiscal Challenges
"As the economy and revenues improve, Virginia will have the opportunity to reinvest in"
public K-12 education. While Virginia leaders should look to fund basic operational
"funds to schools where warranted, with a focus on classroom instruction and minimizing"

Actions to Meet the Goal
The Board of Education adopted Guidelines for the Prevention of Sexual Misconduct and
Abuse in Virginia Public Schools to help school divisions meet their obligation under the
law and create and implement policies and procedures that establish clear and reasonable
"boundaries for interactions between students and teachers, other school board employees,"
and adult volunteers. The model policies and best practices in the document draw from
policies and legislation approved by school boards and legislatures in other states and
policies and best practices implemented by private and parochial schools and national
youth-service organizations.
"On the student health front, the Board of Education worked with the state’s health care"
leaders and other interested stakeholders to develop guidelines for concussions in
"student-athletes. This topic has garnered much national attention within the past year, and"
several other states have consulted VDOE staff because Virginia’s guidelines are
considered by some to be a national model.
The Virginia Department of Education has provided its own research and resources by
"developing a study focusing on the use of online, interactive, story-based lessons on"
"various Internet safety issues, including cyberbullying. The resulting research, presented"
"at the annual meeting of the American Educational Research Association, demonstrated"
that these lessons had a positive impact on the behavior of fourth-grade students.
"Subsequently, this project has been continued using Garfield characters and created in"
cooperation with the Professor Garfield Foundation.
Performance Measures for Goal 7: What the Data Show
Incidents of Crime and Violence in Public Schools
"In 2009-2010, there were 41,913 fewer required reporting incidents than reported in"
2008-2009. Comparison of the most frequently reported incidents reported in 2009-2010
with incidents reported in 2008-2009 shows a decline in incidents of attendance
"(-29,589), classroom/campus disruption (-3,172), disrespect (-2,323), other school"
"violations (-1,268), bullying (-1,201) obscene language/gestures (-1,160), and minor"
"insubordinations (-1,033)."
Incidents that were reported in 2009-2010 in comparison with incidents reported in 2008-
"2009 show an increase in incidents of defiance (+1,787), cellular phones (+952),"
"inappropriate personal property (+130), possession of obscene/disruptive literature +129)"
and drug use possession or sales/distribution of Schedule I or II (+122).
"Nationally and throughout Virginia, school personnel, parents, and the public express"
concern about students’ classroom conduct and academic achievement. Traditional
"approaches to student discipline have had mixed results reducing disruptive behavior,"
"vandalism, or the drop-out rate. The Board has expressed its interest in a discipline"
program called Effective Schoolwide Discipline. Over 20 years of classroom research
supports Effective Schoolwide Discipline (ESD/PBIS) as a proven effective way to not
"only improve student behavior, but also to improve academic performance. Reductions"
in disciplinary consequences have increased the amount of time for classroom instruction.
2011 Annual Report on Condition and Needs of Public Schools
Page 53
Reductions in disciplinary consequences have increased the amount of time available to
administrators for other duties.
The Needs of Public Schools:
What Remains to be Done to Accomplish Goal 7
A high priority for the Board is dealing effectively with the realities of schooling for
"some children who face difficult personal circumstances such as high poverty, high crime"
"in their neighborhoods, high rates of unhealthy behaviors, poor nutrition, and other"
circumstances that obstruct their learning at school. The Board of Education must help
"school divisions by providing solid, workable guidelines and policies to assist those who"
"are responsible for the health and safety of students and staff while they are at school, on"
"school grounds, on their way to and from school, and involved in school-sponsored"
"activities. The Board must continue to stress the importance of successful,"
communitywide partnerships in the development of procedures and policies that most
"effectively support healthy, safe, orderly and disciplined school environments."
"As more and more research in Internet safety shows, it is clear that cyberbullying is one"
of the most pressing issues involved in keeping public schools and the children in them
safe. The Board of Education has supported the Virginia Department of Education’s
efforts to address this issue with the Guidelines and Resources for Internet Safety in
Schools.
Integral to safe and healthy school environments is parent and family involvement. The
family and the home are both critical education institutions where children begin learning
"long before they start school, and where they spend much of their time after they start"
school. Such involvement is critical if we are to improve the educational achievement of
"Virginia’s students, promote safe and healthy school environments, and eliminate"
"achievement gaps. To do this, schools need to promote and enhance cooperative"
partnerships in which families are allies in the efforts of teachers and schools.
Multidivision Online Providers
"In 2010, the Virginia General Assembly passed legislation authorizing the establishment"
of virtual school programs. The legislation required the Superintendent of Public
Instruction to develop and the Virginia Board of Education to approve criteria for
"approving, monitoring, and, if necessary, revoking the contracts of multidivision"
providers of online courses and virtual school programs. It stipulated that the courses or
programs must meet certain requirements with regard to accreditation and staffing and
that the educational objectives and assessments meet or exceed the Virginia Standards of
Learning (SOL) and Standards of Accreditation.
2011 Annual Report on Condition and Needs of Public Schools
Page 54
"Throughout 2011, the Department of Education produced and implemented the"
"multidivision online provider application process, including the development of Criteria"
"for Approval of Multidivision Online Providers and the application, appeal, and"
"monitoring process. The application window was open for 30 days, beginning on"
"February 1, 2011. During that time, 14 organizations submitted applications and course"
"correlation documents. After a thorough review, 13 of these organizations were approved"
to offer online instruction as multidivision online providers. For the one rejected
"application, review teams noted significant deficiencies in policies, pupil performance"
"standards, Section 508 compliance, teacher licensure requirements, and correlation to the"
Standards of Learning.
Please see Appendix G for the full report on multidivision online providers.
Compliance with the Requirements of the
Standards of Quality
One hundred-four divisions reported full compliance with the provisions of the Standards
of Quality (SOQ) in the 2010-2011 school year. Appendices A and B contain
information and a list of school divisions that have reported noncompliance with any of
the provisions of the SOQ. The appendices also provide additional information on the
status of compliance over the last three years for these divisions.
"Where divisions indicate less than full compliance with the standards, corrective action"
plans for the noncompliance items are required. Of the divisions that were not in full
"compliance, all have filed a corrective action plan. The data are for the 2010-2011 school"
"year and for the Standards of Quality that were in effect as of July 1, 2010."
Appendix D contains a summary of the revisions to the Standards of Quality adopted by
"the 2011 General Assembly, and Appendix E contains the full text of the Standards of"

Compliance with the Requirements of the
Standards of Accreditation
"Ninety-six percent of Virginia’s 1,838 public schools are fully accredited and meeting all"
"state standards for achievement in English, mathematics, history and science — and"
"graduation, in the case of high schools. Ninety-eight percent of Virginia’s elementary"
schools and 97 percent of middle schools are fully accredited for the 2011-2012 school
"year, based on the performance of students on Standards of Learning (SOL) and other"
state assessments during 2010-2011. The percentage of fully accredited high schools
"dropped to 86 percent, compared with 99 percent last year, as the Board of Education"
introduced a “graduation and completion index” as a new accountability factor for high
"schools, in addition to student achievement on state tests. More detailed information is"
contained in Appendix C.

Closing Statement by the Virginia Board of Education
The condition and needs of Virginia’s public schools described in this report should be
viewed as guideposts for action. The information in this report points toward critical
areas of need that will undermine Virginia’s future success if not addressed quickly and
effectively. Public education benefits everyone. It is the key to ensuring quality of life
and economic prosperity for Virginia’s citizens both now and in the future.
The encouraging progress made by Virginia’s schools and students should not mask the
realities of schooling for some children who may face difficult personal circumstances
"such as high poverty, high crime in their neighborhoods, and other circumstances that"
"obstruct their learning at school. Moreover, the condition and needs of schools surely"
reflect the condition and needs found in their communities. While the achievement gaps
"that exist among groups of students are narrowing, the gaps persist and provide a huge"
challenge to our public schools.
Raising the rigor of Virginia’s academic standards is a challenge faced by the Board of
Education in its drive to focus on college and career readiness standards that are
internationally competitive. As schools implement more rigorous standards and tests in
"English and mathematics, there may be further declines in accreditation. We must not"
become alarmed or discouraged. We must not give into temptation to preserve the status
quo. Raising standards is the right thing to do and our teachers and schools will rise to the
challenge and Virginia students will be better prepared as a result.
The Board of Education is bold in its expectations and the actions taken as a result. It also
acknowledges the challenges our students will face as they grow into productive adult
"citizens of the global economy—the rapid growth in technology, the changing"
"demographics of our communities, and greater demands for skills for all citizens."
"With its comprehensive plan of action as its roadmap, the Board of Education’s"
overarching goal is for all of Virginia’s public school graduates to be college and career
ready.

APPENDIX A:
Compliance with the Standards of Quality: 2010-2011
One hundred-four divisions (78%) reported full compliance with the provisions of the
Standards of Quality (SOQ) in the 2010-2011 school year. Appendix B contains a list of
school divisions that have reported non-compliance with any of the provisions of the
SOQ. The appendix also provides additional information on the status of compliance
over the last three years for these divisions.
Section 22.1-18 of the Code of Virginia requires the Board of Education to “identify any
school divisions and the specific schools therein which have failed to establish and
"maintain schools meeting the existing prescribed standards of quality.” Each year, the"
Department of Education collects self-assessment data from school divisions on their
compliance with the provisions of § 22.1-253.13:1 through 22.1-253.13:8 of the Code of
Virginia (Standards of Quality). The chairman of the school board and division
superintendent certify the level of compliance with the standards and the individual
indicators within each standard to the Department of Education via an electronic data
collection system.
"Where divisions indicate less than full compliance with the standards, corrective action"
plans for the noncompliance items are required. Of the divisions that were not in full
"compliance, all have filed a corrective action plan. The data are for the 2010-2011 school"
"year and for the Standards of Quality that were in effect as of July 1, 2010."

Appendix D:
Code of Virginia – Standards of Quality
"Effective July 1, 2011"
§ 22.1-253.13:1. Standard 1. Instructional programs supporting the Standards of Learning and other educational
objectives.
A. The General Assembly and the Board of Education believe that the fundamental goal of the public schools of this
"Commonwealth must be to enable each student to develop the skills that are necessary for success in school, preparation for life,"
and reaching their full potential. The General Assembly and the Board of Education find that the quality of education is
"dependent upon the provision of (i) the appropriate working environment, benefits, and salaries necessary to ensure the"
availability of high-quality instructional personnel; (ii) the appropriate learning environment designed to promote student
achievement; (iii) quality instruction that enables each student to become a productive and educated citizen of Virginia and the
"United States of America; and (iv) the adequate commitment of other resources. In keeping with this goal, the General Assembly"
"shall provide for the support of public education as set forth in Article VIII, Section 1 of the Constitution of Virginia."
"B. The Board of Education shall establish educational objectives known as the Standards of Learning, which shall form the core"
"of Virginia's educational program, and other educational objectives, which together are designed to ensure the development of the"
"skills that are necessary for success in school and for preparation for life in the years beyond. At a minimum, the Board shall"
"establish Standards of Learning for English, mathematics, science, and history and social science. The Standards of Learning"
shall not be construed to be regulations as defined in § 2.2-4001.
The Board shall seek to ensure that the Standards of Learning are consistent with a high-quality foundation educational program.
"The Standards of Learning shall include, but not be limited to, the basic skills of communication (listening, speaking, reading,"
and writing); computation and critical reasoning including problem solving and decision making; proficiency in the use of
computers and related technology; and the skills to manage personal finances and to make sound financial decisions.
The English Standards of Learning for reading in kindergarten through grade three shall be based on components of effective
"reading instruction, to include, at a minimum, phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary development, and text"
comprehension.
The Standards of Learning in all subject areas shall be subject to regular review and revision to maintain rigor and to reflect a
balance between content knowledge and the application of knowledge in preparation for eventual employment and lifelong
"learning. The Board of Education shall establish a regular schedule, in a manner it deems appropriate, for the review, and revision"
"as may be necessary, of the Standards of Learning in all subject areas. Such review of each subject area shall occur at least once"
every seven years. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the Board from conducting such review and revision on a
more frequent basis.
"To provide appropriate opportunity for input from the general public, teachers, and local school boards, the Board of Education"
"shall conduct public hearings prior to establishing revised Standards of Learning. Thirty days prior to conducting such hearings,"
"the Board shall give notice of the date, time, and place of the hearings to all local school boards and any other persons requesting"
to be notified of the hearings and publish notice of its intention to revise the Standards of Learning in the Virginia Register of
Regulations. Interested parties shall be given reasonable opportunity to be heard and present information prior to final adoption
of any revisions of the Standards of Learning.
"In addition, the Department of Education shall make available and maintain a website, either separately or through an existing"
"website utilized by the Department of Education, enabling public elementary, middle, and high school educators to submit"
"recommendations for improvements relating to the Standards of Learning, when under review by the Board according to its"
"established schedule, and related assessments required by the Standards of Quality pursuant to this chapter. Such website shall"
facilitate the submission of recommendations by educators.
School boards shall implement the Standards of Learning or objectives specifically designed for their school divisions that are
equivalent to or exceed the Board's requirements. Students shall be expected to achieve the educational objectives established by
the school division at appropriate age or grade levels. The curriculum adopted by the local school division shall be aligned to the
Standards of Learning.
The Board of Education shall include in the Standards of Learning for history and social science the study of contributions to
"society of diverse people. For the purposes of this subsection, ""diverse"" shall include consideration of disability, ethnicity, race,"
and gender.
"With such funds as are made available for this purpose, the Board shall regularly review and revise the competencies for career"
"and technical education programs to require the full integration of English, mathematics, science, and history and social science"
73
Standards of Learning. Career and technical education programs shall be aligned with industry and professional standard
"certifications, where they exist."
C. Local school boards shall develop and implement a program of instruction for grades K through 12 that is aligned to the
Standards of Learning and meets or exceeds the requirements of the Board of Education. The program of instruction shall
"emphasize reading, writing, speaking, mathematical concepts and computations, proficiency in the use of computers and related"
"technology, and scientific concepts and processes; essential skills and concepts of citizenship, including knowledge of Virginia"
"history and world and United States history, economics, government, foreign languages, international cultures, health and"
"physical education, environmental issues and geography necessary for responsible participation in American society and in the"
"international community; fine arts, which may include, but need not be limited to, music and art, and practical arts; knowledge"
"and skills needed to qualify for further education, gainful employment, or training in a career or technical field; and development"
of the ability to apply such skills and knowledge in preparation for eventual employment and lifelong learning and to achieve
economic self-sufficiency.
"Local school boards shall also develop and implement programs of prevention, intervention, or remediation for students who are"
"educationally at risk including, but not limited to, those who fail to achieve a passing score on any Standards of Learning"
assessment in grades three through eight or who fail an end-of-course test required for the award of a verified unit of credit. Such
programs shall include components that are research-based.
"Any student who achieves a passing score on one or more, but not all, of the Standards of Learning assessments for the relevant"
grade level in grades three through eight may be required to attend a remediation program.
Any student who fails to achieve a passing score on all of the Standards of Learning assessments for the relevant grade level in
grades three through eight or who fails an end-of-course test required for the award of a verified unit of credit shall be required to
attend a remediation program or to participate in another form of remediation. Division superintendents shall require such
"students to take special programs of prevention, intervention, or remediation, which may include attendance in public summer"
"school programs, in accordance with clause (ii) of subsection A of § 22.1-254 and § 22.1-254.01."
"Remediation programs shall include, when applicable, a procedure for early identification of students who are at risk of failing"
the Standards of Learning assessments in grades three through eight or who fail an end-of-course test required for the award of a
verified unit of credit. Such programs may also include summer school for all elementary and middle school grades and for all
"high school academic courses, as defined by regulations promulgated by the Board of Education, or other forms of remediation."
Summer school remediation programs or other forms of remediation shall be chosen by the division superintendent to be
appropriate to the academic needs of the student. Students who are required to attend such summer school programs or to
participate in another form of remediation shall not be charged tuition by the school division.
"The requirement for remediation may, however, be satisfied by the student's attendance in a program of prevention, intervention"
"or remediation that has been selected by his parent, in consultation with the division superintendent or his designee, and is either"
(i) conducted by an accredited private school or (ii) a special program that has been determined to be comparable to the required
public school remediation program by the division superintendent. The costs of such private school remediation program or other
special remediation program shall be borne by the student's parent.
"The Board of Education shall establish standards for full funding of summer remedial programs that shall include, but not be"
"limited to, the minimum number of instructional hours or the equivalent thereof required for full funding and an assessment"
system designed to evaluate program effectiveness. Based on the number of students attending and the Commonwealth's share of
"the per pupil instructional costs, state funds shall be provided for the full cost of summer and other remediation programs as set"
"forth in the appropriation act, provided such programs comply with such standards as shall be established by the Board, pursuant"
to § 22.1-199.2.
74
D. Local school boards shall also implement the following:
1. Programs in grades K through three that emphasize developmentally appropriate learning to enhance success.
"2. Programs based on prevention, intervention, or remediation designed to increase the number of students who earn a high"
school diploma and to prevent students from dropping out of school. Such programs shall include components that are research-
based.
3. Career and technical education programs incorporated into the K through 12 curricula that include:
"a. Knowledge of careers and all types of employment opportunities including, but not limited to, apprenticeships,"
"entrepreneurship and small business ownership, the military, and the teaching profession, and emphasize the advantages of"
completing school with marketable skills;
b. Career exploration opportunities in the middle school grades; and
"c. Competency-based career and technical education programs that integrate academic outcomes, career guidance and job-"
seeking skills for all secondary students. Programs must be based upon labor market needs and student interest. Career guidance
shall include counseling about available employment opportunities and placement services for students exiting school. Each
school board shall develop and implement a plan to ensure compliance with the provisions of this subdivision. Such plan shall be
developed with the input of area business and industry representatives and local community colleges and shall be submitted to the
Superintendent of Public Instruction in accordance with the timelines established by federal law.
4. Educational objectives in middle and high school that emphasize economic education and financial literacy pursuant to § 22.1-
200.03.
5. Early identification of students with disabilities and enrollment of such students in appropriate instructional programs
consistent with state and federal law.
6. Early identification of gifted students and enrollment of such students in appropriately differentiated instructional programs.
7. Educational alternatives for students whose needs are not met in programs prescribed elsewhere in these standards. Such
students shall be counted in average daily membership (ADM) in accordance with the regulations of the Board of Education.
8. Adult education programs for individuals functioning below the high school completion level. Such programs may be
conducted by the school board as the primary agency or through a collaborative arrangement between the school board and other
agencies.

14. A program of physical fitness available to all students with a goal of at least 150 minutes per week on average during the
"regular school year. Such program may include any combination of (i) physical education classes, (ii) extracurricular athletics, or"
(iii) other programs and physical activities deemed appropriate by the local school board.
Each local school board shall incorporate into its local wellness policy a goal for the implementation of such program during the
regular school year.
"15. A program of student services for grades kindergarten through 12 that shall be designed to aid students in their educational,"

the capacity for school divisions to deliver quality instruction; and (iii) assist school divisions in implementing those programs
and practices that will enhance pupil academic performance and improve family and community involvement in the public
schools. Such unit shall identify and analyze effective instructional programs and practices and professional development
initiatives; evaluate the success of programs encouraging parental and family involvement; assess changes in student outcomes
prompted by family involvement; and collect and disseminate among school divisions information regarding effective
"instructional programs and practices, initiatives promoting family and community involvement, and potential funding and support"
sources. Such unit may also provide resources supporting professional development for administrators and teachers. In providing
"such information, resources, and other services to school divisions, the unit shall give priority to those divisions demonstrating a"
less than 70 percent passing rate on the Standards of Learning assessments.

"Within its regulations governing special education programs, the Board shall seek to set pupil/teacher ratios for pupils with"
mental retardation that do not exceed the pupil/teacher ratios for self-contained classes for pupils with specific learning
disabilities.
"Further, school boards shall assign instructional personnel in a manner that produces schoolwide ratios of students in average"
daily memberships to full-time equivalent teaching positions of 21 to one in middle schools and high schools. School divisions
"shall provide all middle and high school teachers with one planning period per day or the equivalent, unencumbered of any"
teaching or supervisory duties.
"D. Each local school board shall employ with state and local basic, special education, gifted, and career and technical education"

"kindergarten programs. Beginning with the March 31 report of average daily membership, those school divisions offering half-"
day kindergarten with pupil/teacher ratios that exceed 30 to one shall adjust their average daily membership for kindergarten to
"reflect 85 percent of the total kindergarten average daily memberships, as provided in the appropriation act."
"E. In addition to the positions supported by basic aid and in support of regular school year programs of prevention, intervention,"
"and remediation, state funding, pursuant to the appropriation act, shall be provided to fund certain full-time equivalent"
"instructional positions for each 1,000 students in grades K through 12 who are identified as needing prevention, intervention, and"
"remediation services. State funding for prevention, intervention, and remediation programs provided pursuant to this subsection"
and the appropriation act may be used to support programs for educationally at-risk students as identified by the local school
boards.
"To provide flexibility in the provision of mathematics intervention services, school divisions may use the Standards of Learning"

"equivalent instructional positions for each 1,000 students identified as having limited English proficiency."
To provide flexibility in the instruction of English language learners who have limited English proficiency and who are at risk of
"not meeting state accountability standards, school divisions may use state and local funds from the Standards of Quality"
"Prevention, Intervention, and Remediation account to employ additional English language learner teachers to provide instruction"

"technical education, fine arts, foreign language, or health education or physical education course shall be counted in the ADM in"
the relevant school division on a pro rata basis as provided in the appropriation act. Each such course enrollment by such students
"shall be counted as 0.25 in the ADM; however, no such nonpublic or home school student shall be counted as more than one-half"
a student for purposes of such pro rata calculation. Such calculation shall not include enrollments of such students in any other
public school courses.
O. Each local school board shall provide those support services that are necessary for the efficient and cost-effective operation
and maintenance of its public schools.

"§ 22.1-253.13:3. Standard 3. Accreditation, other standards and evaluation."
A. The Board of Education shall promulgate regulations establishing standards for accreditation pursuant to the Administrative
"Process Act (§ 2.2-4000 et seq.), which shall include, but not be limited to, student outcome measures, requirements and"
"guidelines for instructional programs and for the integration of educational technology into such instructional programs,"
"administrative and instructional staffing levels and positions, including staff positions for supporting educational technology,"
"student services, auxiliary education programs such as library and media services, course and credit requirements for graduation"
"from high school, community relations, and the philosophy, goals, and objectives of public education in Virginia."
The Board shall review annually the accreditation status of all schools in the Commonwealth.
Each local school board shall maintain schools that are fully accredited pursuant to the standards for accreditation as prescribed
by the Board of Education. Each local school board shall review the accreditation status of all schools in the local school division
"annually in public session. Within the time specified by the Board of Education, each school board shall submit corrective action"
plans for any schools within its school division that have been designated as not meeting the standards as approved by the Board.
When the Board of Education has obtained evidence through the school academic review process that the failure of schools
"within a division to achieve full accreditation status is related to division level failure to implement the Standards of Quality, the"
Board may require a division level academic review. After the conduct of such review and within the time specified by the Board
78
"of Education, each school board shall submit for approval by the Board a corrective action plan, consistent with criteria"
established by the Board and setting forth specific actions and a schedule designed to ensure that schools within its school
division achieve full accreditation status. Such corrective action plans shall be part of the relevant school division's
comprehensive plan pursuant to § 22.1-253.13:6.
"With such funds as are appropriated or otherwise received for this purpose, the Board shall adopt and implement an academic"
"review process, to be conducted by the Department of Education, to assist schools that are accredited with warning. The"
"Department shall forward a report of each academic review to the relevant local school board, and such school board shall report"
the results of such academic review and the required annual progress reports in public session. The local school board shall
implement any actions identified through the academic review and utilize them for improvement planning.
B. The Superintendent of Public Instruction shall develop and the Board of Education shall approve criteria for determining and
"recognizing educational performance in the Commonwealth's public school divisions and schools. Such criteria, when approved,"
shall become an integral part of the accreditation process and shall include student outcome measurements. The Superintendent
of Public Instruction shall annually identify to the Board those school divisions and schools that exceed or do not meet the
approved criteria. Such identification shall include an analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of public education programs in
the various school divisions in Virginia and recommendations to the General Assembly for further enhancing student learning
"uniformly across the Commonwealth. In recognizing educational performance in the school divisions, the Board shall include"
"consideration of special school division accomplishments, such as numbers of dual enrollments and students in Advanced"
"Placement and International Baccalaureate courses, and participation in academic year Governor's Schools."
The Superintendent of Public Instruction shall assist local school boards in the implementation of action plans for increasing
educational performance in those school divisions and schools that are identified as not meeting the approved criteria. The
Superintendent of Public Instruction shall monitor the implementation of and report to the Board of Education on the
effectiveness of the corrective actions taken to improve the educational performance in such school divisions and schools.
"C. With such funds as are available for this purpose, the Board of Education shall prescribe assessment methods to determine the"
"level of achievement of the Standards of Learning objectives by all students. Such assessments shall evaluate knowledge,"
"application of knowledge, critical thinking, and skills related to the Standards of Learning being assessed. The Board shall (i) in"
"consultation with the chairpersons of the eight regional superintendents' study groups, establish a timetable for administering the"
Standards of Learning assessments to ensure genuine end-of-course and end-of-grade testing and (ii) with the assistance of
"independent testing experts, conduct a regular analysis and validation process for these assessments."
"In prescribing such Standards of Learning assessments, the Board shall provide local school boards the option of administering"
"tests for United States History to 1877, United States History: 1877 to the Present, and Civics and Economics. The last"
administration of the cumulative grade eight history test will be during the 2007-2008 academic school year. Beginning with the
"2008-2009 academic year, all school divisions shall administer the United States History to 1877, United States History: 1877 to"
"the Present, and Civics and Economics tests. The Board shall also provide the option of industry certification and state licensure"
examinations as a student-selected verified credit.
The Board of Education shall make publicly available such assessments in a timely manner and as soon as practicable following
"the administration of such tests, so long as the release of such assessments does not compromise test security or deplete the bank"
"of assessment questions necessary to construct subsequent tests, or limit the ability to test students on demand and provide"
immediate results in the web-based assessment system.
The Board shall include in the student outcome measures that are required by the Standards for Accreditation end-of-course or
"end-of-grade tests for various grade levels and classes, as determined by the Board, in accordance with the Standards of Learning."
"These Standards of Learning assessments shall include, but need not be limited to, end-of-course or end-of-grade tests for"
"English, mathematics, science, and history and social science."
"In addition, to assess the educational progress of students, the Board of Education shall (i) develop appropriate assessments,"
which may include criterion-referenced tests and alternative assessment instruments that may be used by classroom teachers; (ii)
"select appropriate industry certification and state licensure examinations and (iii) prescribe and provide measures, which may"
include nationally normed tests to be used to identify students who score in the bottom quartile at selected grade levels. An
annual justification that includes evidence that the student meets the participation criteria defined by the Virginia Department of
Education shall be provided for each student considered for the Virginia Grade Level Alternative. Each Individual Education
Program team shall review such justification and make the final determination as to whether or not the Virginia Grade Level
Alternative is appropriate for the student. The superintendent and the school board chairman shall certify to the Board of
"Education, as a part of certifying compliance with the Standards of Quality, that there is a justification in the Individual"
Education Program for every student who takes the Virginia Grade Level Alternative. Compliance with this requirement shall be
monitored as a part of the special education monitoring process conducted by the Department of Education. The Board shall
report to the Governor and General Assembly in its annual reports pursuant to § 22.1-18 any school division that is not in
compliance with this requirement.
79
"The Standard of Learning requirements, including all related assessments, shall be waived for any student awarded a scholarship"
"under the Brown v. Board of Education Scholarship Program, pursuant to § 30-231.2, who is enrolled in a preparation program"
for the General Education Development (GED) certificate or in an adult basic education program to obtain the high school
diploma.
The Board of Education may adopt special provisions related to the administration and use of any SOL test or tests in a content
area as applied to accreditation ratings for any period during which the SOL content or assessments in that area are being revised
"and phased in. Prior to statewide administration of such tests, the Board of Education shall provide notice to local school boards"
regarding such special provisions.
D. The Board of Education may pursue all available civil remedies pursuant to § 22.1-19.1 or administrative action pursuant to §
22.1-292.1 for breaches in test security and unauthorized alteration of test materials or test results.
"The Board may initiate or cause to be initiated a review or investigation of any alleged breach in security, unauthorized alteration,"
"or improper administration of tests, including the exclusion of students from testing who are required to be assessed, by local"
school board employees responsible for the distribution or administration of the tests.
Records and other information furnished to or prepared by the Board during the conduct of a review or investigation may be
"withheld pursuant to subdivision 12 of § 2.2-3705.3. However, this section shall not prohibit the disclosure of records to (i) a"
local school board or division superintendent for the purpose of permitting such board or superintendent to consider or to take
"personnel action with regard to an employee or (ii) any requester, after the conclusion of a review or investigation, in a form that"
(a) does not reveal the identity of any person making a complaint or supplying information to the Board on a confidential basis
and (b) does not compromise the security of any test mandated by the Board. Any local school board or division superintendent
"receiving such records or other information shall, upon taking personnel action against a relevant employee, place copies of such"
records or information relating to the specific employee in such person's personnel file.
"Notwithstanding any other provision of state law, no test or examination authorized by this section, including the Standards of"
"Learning assessments, shall be released or required to be released as minimum competency tests, if, in the judgment of the Board,"
such release would breach the security of such test or examination or deplete the bank of questions necessary to construct future
secure tests.
"E. With such funds as may be appropriated, the Board of Education may provide, through an agreement with vendors having the"
"technical capacity and expertise to provide computerized tests and assessments, and test construction, analysis, and security, for"
(i) web-based computerized tests and assessments for the evaluation of student progress during and after remediation and (ii) the
development of a remediation item bank directly related to the Standards of Learning.
"F. To assess the educational progress of students as individuals and as groups, each local school board shall require the use of"
"Standards of Learning assessments and other relevant data, such as industry certification and state licensure examinations, to"
evaluate student progress and to determine educational performance. Each local school shall require the administration of
"appropriate assessments to all students for grade levels and courses identified by the Board of Education, which may include"
"criterion-referenced tests, teacher-made tests and alternative assessment instruments and shall include the Standards of Learning"
Assessments and the National Assessment of Educational Progress state-by-state assessment. Each school board shall analyze
"and report annually, in compliance with any criteria that may be established by the Board of Education, the results from the"
"Stanford Achievement Test Series, Ninth Edition (Stanford Nine) assessment, if administered, industry certification"
"examinations, and the Standards of Learning Assessments to the public."
"The Board of Education shall not require administration of the Stanford Achievement Test Series, Ninth Edition (Stanford Nine)"
"assessment, except as may be selected to facilitate compliance with the requirements for home instruction pursuant to § 22.1-"
254.1.
The Board shall include requirements for the reporting of the Standards of Learning assessment scores and averages for each year
as part of the Board's requirements relating to the School Performance Report Card. Such scores shall be disaggregated for each
school by student subgroups on the Virginia assessment program as appropriate and shall be reported to the public within three
months of their receipt. These reports (i) shall be posted on the portion of the Department of Education's website relating to the
"School Performance Report Card, in a format and in a manner that allows year-to-year comparisons, and (ii) may include the"
National Assessment of Educational Progress state-by-state assessment.
G. Each local school division superintendent shall regularly review the division's submission of data and reports required by state
and federal law and regulations to ensure that all information is accurate and submitted in a timely fashion. The Superintendent of
Public Instruction shall provide a list of the required reports and data to division superintendents annually. The status of
compliance with this requirement shall be included in the Board of Education's annual report to the Governor and the General
Assembly as required by § 22.1-18.
80

Education. Provisions shall be made to facilitate the transfer and appropriate grade placement of students from other public
"secondary schools, from nonpublic schools, or from home instruction as outlined in the standards for accreditation. Course credits"
earned for online courses taken in the Department of Education's Virtual Virginia program shall transfer to Virginia public
"schools in accordance with provisions of the standards for accreditation. Further, reasonable accommodation to meet the"
requirements for diplomas shall be provided for otherwise qualified students with disabilities as needed.
"In addition, each local school board may devise, vis-a-vis the award of diplomas to secondary school students, a mechanism for"
calculating class rankings that takes into consideration whether the student has taken a required class more than one time and has
had any prior earned grade for such required class expunged.
Each local school board shall notify the parents of rising eleventh and twelfth grade students of (i) the number and subject area
requirements of standard and verified units of credit required for graduation pursuant to the standards for accreditation and (ii)

"As required by § 22.1-18, the Board of Education shall submit to the Governor and the General Assembly a report on the"
condition and needs of public education in the Commonwealth and shall identify any school divisions and the specific schools
therein that have failed to establish and maintain schools meeting the existing prescribed Standards of Quality.
The Board of Education shall have authority to seek school division compliance with the foregoing Standards of Quality. When
"the Board of Education determines that a school division has failed or refused, and continues to fail or refuse, to comply with any"
"such Standard, the Board may petition the circuit court having jurisdiction in the school division to mandate or otherwise enforce"
"compliance with such standard, including the development or implementation of any required corrective action plan that a local"
school board has failed or refused to develop or implement in a timely manner.
§ 22.1-253.13:9. Virginia Index of Performance incentive program.
A. Schools and local school divisions shall be recognized by the Board of Education in accordance with guidelines it shall
establish for the Virginia Index of Performance (VIP) incentive program. The VIP incentive program shall be designed to
recognize and reward fully accredited schools and school divisions that make significant progress toward achieving advanced
"proficiency levels in reading, mathematics, science, and history and social science, and on other indicators of school and student"
performance that are aligned with the Commonwealth's goals for public education.
Such recognition may include:
1. Public announcements recognizing individual schools and divisions;
2. Tangible rewards;
3. Waivers of certain board regulations;
4. Exemptions from certain reporting requirements; or
5. Other commendations deemed appropriate to recognize high achievement.
"In addition to Board recognition, local school boards shall adopt policies to recognize individual schools through public"
announcements or media releases as well as other appropriate recognition.
"In order to encourage school divisions to promote student achievement in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, the"
Board of Education shall take into account in its guidelines a school division's increase in enrollments and elective course
offerings in these areas.
85
B. A school that maintains a passing rate on Virginia assessment program tests or additional tests approved by the Board of 95
"percent or above in each of the four core academic areas for two consecutive years may, upon application to the Department of"
"Education, receive a waiver from annual accreditation. A school receiving such a waiver shall be fully accredited for a three-year"
"period. However, such school shall continue to annually submit documentation in compliance with the pre-accreditation"
eligibility requirements.
C. Schools may be eligible to receive the Governor's Award for Outstanding Achievement. This award will be given to schools rated fully
accredited that significantly increase the achievement of students within student subgroups in accordance with guidelines prescribed by
the Board of Education.

Appendix F: Information on Rebenchmarking State Basic Aid
State funding for K-12 education in Virginia represents one-third of the state general fund (GF)
"budget and is its largest portion. State K-12 funding in FY12 is $5.5 billion, mostly from GFs"
"but also other state sources. From FY02 to FY12, state K-12 funding increased 37 percent while"
enrollment increased only 6.5 percent. Much of the new spending during this time prior to the
recession was to fund increased standards under Virginia’s Standards of Quality.
The Direct Aid to Public Education budget provides state funding to school divisions for
"prekindergarten-12 educational programs. In each odd-numbered year, the cost of the Direct Aid"
to Public Education budget is rebenchmarked for the next biennium. The rebenchmarked budget
represents the state cost of continuing the existing Direct Aid to Public Education programs with
biennial updates in the input data used to determine the cost of the programs.

Issues and Challenges,
"During the implementation, several challenges emerged:",
•,"Some of the providers’ course names were not the same as those used in the SOL; for example, a provider’s"
,"World Literature II course was comparable to the English Grade 10 SOL. In addition, the providers were"
,"allowed to offer elective courses that did not correlate to any standard, which also caused confusion; for"
,"example, one provider’s Algebra I course correlated with the SOL, while another’s elective Algebra I"
,course did not fully correlate.
•,Multidivision online providers were allowed to revise and resubmit course correlation documentation at
,any time after the application window closed. This decision was made because of logistical challenges
,"related to the tight deadline and to ensure the highest quality submissions. This resulted, however, in a"
,continuous review of provider content.
•,The Department of Education originally required multidivision online providers to provide teacher and
,"administrator licensure information at the time of application; however, the providers would not employ"
,"and assign teachers until enough students had registered for the courses. As a result, the rule was revised,"
,allowing providers to submit teacher credentials once they were confident that the course had sufficient
,enrollment to be offered.
•,Providers and school divisions were confused about what constitutes a multidivision online provider as
,"compared to a provider of online content taught by a local teacher. To address this problem, the Department"
,of Education issued clarification and provided training to assist divisions in reporting data correctly.
•,The definitions of “full-time” and “part-time” students need to be clarified. This issue has made it difficult
,to design data collection processes.

based on the Criteria for Approving Multidivision Online Providers. These teams will prepare a report with
recommendations for the Superintendent of Public Instruction within 30 business days of the close of the
application period.
The Superintendent of Public Instruction will make a decision regarding approval of multidivision online
providers and official notification of approval or notification of denial will be mailed to the applicant within
45 business days of the close of the application period. The letter will be sent by the U.S. Postal Service
and will include detailed reasons for denial if applicable.
Appeals Process for Multidivision Online Providers
"If the Superintendent of Public Instruction denies approval of an application, the applicant may submit a"
revised application within 30 business days of notification; the applicant is not required to submit a revised
application. The Superintendent of Public Instruction will review any changes and either approve or deny
the resubmitted application within 45 business days from the receipt of a resubmitted application.
"An applicant whose application has been denied by the Superintendent of Public Instruction, either upon"
"the original submission of the application or upon submission of a revised application, may appeal the"
decision of the Superintendent of Public Instruction to the Virginia Board of Education.
The appeal must be submitted to the Virginia Board of Education within 30 business days of the mailing of
the decision being appealed. The appeal must be in writing. The appeal shall contain: (1) a copy of the
decision being appealed; (2) the applicant’s statement of the errors alleged in the decision of the
Superintendent of Public Instruction; and (3) together with those portions of the application that bear on the
issues on appeal.
"The appeal to the Board is on the record, and the Board will not receive additional information, except for"
"good cause shown. “Good cause” means: (1) there is significant, relevant information not previously"
available and not presented to the Superintendent of Public Instruction; (2) there have been significant
changes in factors or circumstances relating to the application subsequent to the application being presented
"to the Superintendent; or (3) there is a substantial material mistake of fact or law in the application, and"
which could not have been avoided by diligence on the part of the applicant.
"Upon receipt of the appeal, the Board will convene to hear the matter; the meeting may be either a regularly"
"scheduled meeting of the Board, or upon a meeting called specially for the purpose. The Board delegates to"
the president the authority to issue such rulings and instructions as will ensure that the appeal is heard in a
"timely, efficient, and effective manner. The Board will render its decision in writing."
Denied applicants may also submit a new application in subsequent application periods.
Regular Monitoring of Multidivision Online Providers
An oversight committee of the Virginia Department of Education will conduct selected reviews of
approved providers and their approved courses each year. The intent of the regular monitoring process is to
provide oversight through periodic review of previously approved programs and to intervene when
"programs no longer meet the Criteria for Approving Multidivision Online Providers, including possible"
revocation of approved programs. Information from the reviews will be used in preparing an annual report
to the Governor and the General Assembly of Virginia.
"The applicant must submit a Provider Monitoring Report each year; however, the Virginia Department of"
Education may request that a Provider Monitoring Report be completed and submitted at any time.
Multidivision online providers must complete a full review after three years.
108
The annual Provider Monitoring Report requires providers to supply updates and changes to their programs
using the online process (see Appendix B). (NOTE: Much of this form will be generated online based on
the original application by the provider and is not shown in Appendix B). The oversight committee will use
the Application Review Rubric (Appendix A) to evaluate the information about program changes as well as
information collected from stakeholder surveys and statistical data related to course completion and student
growth and achievement. The oversight committee will make a recommendation within 30 business days.
"Based on the recommendation of the oversight committee, a decision regarding the continued approval of"
multidivision online providers will be made by the Superintendent of Public Instruction within 15 business
days of receipt of the monitoring report. The applicants will be notified of their status via a letter sent by
the U.S. Postal Service within 45 business days of the end of the monitoring report period.
A multidivision online provider who no longer meets the Criteria for Approving Multidivision Online
Providers is placed on provisional status (they may continue to serve Virginia students currently enrolled in
the multidivision online program but cannot enroll new students or enter into new multidivision online
provider contracts) and must address the concerns of the oversight committee and the Superintendent of
Public Instruction within 40 business days of receipt of notification. If the provider does not address the
"concerns to the satisfaction of the Superintendent of Public Instruction, the approval status of the provider"
"may be revoked at the end of the academic year or provisional status may be extended; however,"
provisional status will not be extended past the full review date.
Revocation Process for Multidivision Online Providers
The approval of a multidivision online provider will remain in effect until the approval is revoked for
"cause, pursuant to section § 22.1-212.24 of the Code of Virginia. The decision regarding revocation of a"
previously approved multidivision online provider will be made by the Superintendent of Public Instruction
based on the oversight committee’s report and recommendation during the monitoring process.
Revocation notices will be made by certified mail within five business days after the decision has been
made.
"If the Superintendent of Public Instruction has revoked a provider’s approval, the applicant may appeal, in"
"writing, to the Virginia Board of Education within 30 business days of the date the revocation letter is"
mailed. The Board of Education will review the appeal within 60 business days of the date the appeal is
received—or at the next public meeting if none takes place within 60 days of receiving the appeal. The
final decision of the Board of Education will be sent by letter to the individual submitting the appeal. This
decision of the Board of Education is intended to be a final “case decision” within the meaning of the
"Virginia Administrative Process Act (APA) § 2.2-4000 et seq. of the Code of Virginia, and subject to further"
review in accordance with the APA and Part 2A of the Supreme Court of Virginia. The APA details the
authority of state agencies to make decisions based on regulations and explains the standard procedures to
be used.
If a provider’s approval is revoked by the Superintendent of Public Instruction and upheld by the Board of
"Education, the applicant may submit a new application during the next application period."
