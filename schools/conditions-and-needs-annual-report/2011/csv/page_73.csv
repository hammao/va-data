Appendix D:
Code of Virginia – Standards of Quality
"Effective July 1, 2011"
§ 22.1-253.13:1. Standard 1. Instructional programs supporting the Standards of Learning and other educational
objectives.
A. The General Assembly and the Board of Education believe that the fundamental goal of the public schools of this
"Commonwealth must be to enable each student to develop the skills that are necessary for success in school, preparation for life,"
and reaching their full potential. The General Assembly and the Board of Education find that the quality of education is
"dependent upon the provision of (i) the appropriate working environment, benefits, and salaries necessary to ensure the"
availability of high-quality instructional personnel; (ii) the appropriate learning environment designed to promote student
achievement; (iii) quality instruction that enables each student to become a productive and educated citizen of Virginia and the
"United States of America; and (iv) the adequate commitment of other resources. In keeping with this goal, the General Assembly"
"shall provide for the support of public education as set forth in Article VIII, Section 1 of the Constitution of Virginia."
"B. The Board of Education shall establish educational objectives known as the Standards of Learning, which shall form the core"
"of Virginia's educational program, and other educational objectives, which together are designed to ensure the development of the"
"skills that are necessary for success in school and for preparation for life in the years beyond. At a minimum, the Board shall"
"establish Standards of Learning for English, mathematics, science, and history and social science. The Standards of Learning"
shall not be construed to be regulations as defined in § 2.2-4001.
The Board shall seek to ensure that the Standards of Learning are consistent with a high-quality foundation educational program.
"The Standards of Learning shall include, but not be limited to, the basic skills of communication (listening, speaking, reading,"
and writing); computation and critical reasoning including problem solving and decision making; proficiency in the use of
computers and related technology; and the skills to manage personal finances and to make sound financial decisions.
The English Standards of Learning for reading in kindergarten through grade three shall be based on components of effective
"reading instruction, to include, at a minimum, phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary development, and text"
comprehension.
The Standards of Learning in all subject areas shall be subject to regular review and revision to maintain rigor and to reflect a
balance between content knowledge and the application of knowledge in preparation for eventual employment and lifelong
"learning. The Board of Education shall establish a regular schedule, in a manner it deems appropriate, for the review, and revision"
"as may be necessary, of the Standards of Learning in all subject areas. Such review of each subject area shall occur at least once"
every seven years. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the Board from conducting such review and revision on a
more frequent basis.
"To provide appropriate opportunity for input from the general public, teachers, and local school boards, the Board of Education"
"shall conduct public hearings prior to establishing revised Standards of Learning. Thirty days prior to conducting such hearings,"
"the Board shall give notice of the date, time, and place of the hearings to all local school boards and any other persons requesting"
to be notified of the hearings and publish notice of its intention to revise the Standards of Learning in the Virginia Register of
Regulations. Interested parties shall be given reasonable opportunity to be heard and present information prior to final adoption
of any revisions of the Standards of Learning.
"In addition, the Department of Education shall make available and maintain a website, either separately or through an existing"
"website utilized by the Department of Education, enabling public elementary, middle, and high school educators to submit"
"recommendations for improvements relating to the Standards of Learning, when under review by the Board according to its"
"established schedule, and related assessments required by the Standards of Quality pursuant to this chapter. Such website shall"
facilitate the submission of recommendations by educators.
School boards shall implement the Standards of Learning or objectives specifically designed for their school divisions that are
equivalent to or exceed the Board's requirements. Students shall be expected to achieve the educational objectives established by
the school division at appropriate age or grade levels. The curriculum adopted by the local school division shall be aligned to the
Standards of Learning.
The Board of Education shall include in the Standards of Learning for history and social science the study of contributions to
"society of diverse people. For the purposes of this subsection, ""diverse"" shall include consideration of disability, ethnicity, race,"
and gender.
"With such funds as are made available for this purpose, the Board shall regularly review and revise the competencies for career"
"and technical education programs to require the full integration of English, mathematics, science, and history and social science"
