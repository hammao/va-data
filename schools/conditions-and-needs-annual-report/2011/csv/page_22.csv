The Board’s Goals: Meeting the Critical Needs of Virginia’s Public Schools
The Board of Education has adopted a comprehensive plan of action for the coming
years. The comprehensive plan outlines the seven goals shown in the following pages.
The goals were set by the Board to address the complex needs and challenges that impact
our schools and our young people. More details on the Board of Education’s

The following pages contain an assessment of the Board’s policy decisions to address
"each of its goals. For each goal, highlights of data to assess the results of recent policy"
decisions and a brief description of the areas that need continued attention are shown.
Goal 1: Expanded Opportunities to Learn: The Board of Education will continue to improve the
standards for public schools in Virginia in order to expand learning opportunities needed for Virginia’s
public schools. Our schools will lead the nation in rigor and quality and our students will compete and
excel in postsecondary education and/or in the global workplace.
Goal 2: Accountability of Student Learning: The Board of Education will support accountability for
all public schools by providing leadership and by establishing policies that help schools and school
"divisions increase the academic success of all students, especially those who are at-risk or in"
"underperforming school systems. Using improved longitudinal data systems, the Board will monitor"
schools’ progress in closing achievement gaps among groups of students.
Goal 3: Nurturing Young Learners: The Board of Education will work cooperatively with partners
and will promote new and innovative partnerships to help ensure that all young children are ready to
enter kindergarten with the skills they need for success.
Goal 4: Strong Literacy and Mathematics Skills: The Board of Education will establish policies that
"support the attainment of literacy and mathematics skills for all students, pre-K through grade 12."
Goal 5: Highly Qualified and Effective Teachers and Administrators: The Board of Education will
"establish policies and standards that improve the preparation, recruitment, and retention of Virginia’s"
"educational personnel, including meaningful and ongoing professional development, especially in"
teacher shortage areas and in hard-to-staff schools.
Goal 6: Sound Policies for Student Success: The Board of Education will provide leadership to
develop and implement the provisions of state and federal laws and regulations in ways that improve
and expand opportunities for all of Virginia’s schoolchildren to excel academically.
Goal 7: Safe and Secure Schools: The Board of Education will provide leadership to create safe and
secure school environments.
