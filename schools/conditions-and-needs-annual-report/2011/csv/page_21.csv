Closing Statement by the Virginia Board of Education
The condition and needs of Virginia’s public schools described in this report should be
viewed as guideposts for action. The information in this report points toward critical
areas of need that will undermine Virginia’s future success if not addressed quickly and
effectively. Public education benefits everyone. It is the key to ensuring quality of life
and economic prosperity for Virginia’s citizens both now and in the future.
The encouraging progress made by Virginia’s schools and students should not mask the
realities of schooling for some children who may face difficult personal circumstances
"such as high poverty, high crime in their neighborhoods, and other circumstances that"
"obstruct their learning at school. Moreover, the condition and needs of schools surely"
reflect the condition and needs found in their communities. While the achievement gaps
"that exist among groups of students are narrowing, the gaps persist and provide a huge"
challenge to our public schools.
Raising the rigor of Virginia’s academic standards is a challenge faced by the Board of
Education in its drive to focus on college and career readiness standards that are
internationally competitive. As schools implement more rigorous standards and tests in
"English and mathematics, there may be further declines in accreditation. We must not"
become alarmed or discouraged. We must not give into temptation to preserve the status
quo. Raising standards is the right thing to do and our teachers and schools will rise to the
challenge and Virginia students will be better prepared as a result.
The Board of Education is bold in its expectations and the actions taken as a result. It also
acknowledges the challenges our students will face as they grow into productive adult
"citizens of the global economy—the rapid growth in technology, the changing"
"demographics of our communities, and greater demands for skills for all citizens."
"With its comprehensive plan of action as its roadmap, the Board of Education’s"
overarching goal is for all of Virginia’s public school graduates to be college and career
ready.
