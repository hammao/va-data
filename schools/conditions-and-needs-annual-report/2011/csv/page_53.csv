Actions to Meet the Goal
The Board of Education adopted Guidelines for the Prevention of Sexual Misconduct and
Abuse in Virginia Public Schools to help school divisions meet their obligation under the
law and create and implement policies and procedures that establish clear and reasonable
"boundaries for interactions between students and teachers, other school board employees,"
and adult volunteers. The model policies and best practices in the document draw from
policies and legislation approved by school boards and legislatures in other states and
policies and best practices implemented by private and parochial schools and national
youth-service organizations.
"On the student health front, the Board of Education worked with the state’s health care"
leaders and other interested stakeholders to develop guidelines for concussions in
"student-athletes. This topic has garnered much national attention within the past year, and"
several other states have consulted VDOE staff because Virginia’s guidelines are
considered by some to be a national model.
The Virginia Department of Education has provided its own research and resources by
"developing a study focusing on the use of online, interactive, story-based lessons on"
"various Internet safety issues, including cyberbullying. The resulting research, presented"
"at the annual meeting of the American Educational Research Association, demonstrated"
that these lessons had a positive impact on the behavior of fourth-grade students.
"Subsequently, this project has been continued using Garfield characters and created in"
cooperation with the Professor Garfield Foundation.
Performance Measures for Goal 7: What the Data Show
Incidents of Crime and Violence in Public Schools
"In 2009-2010, there were 41,913 fewer required reporting incidents than reported in"
2008-2009. Comparison of the most frequently reported incidents reported in 2009-2010
with incidents reported in 2008-2009 shows a decline in incidents of attendance
"(-29,589), classroom/campus disruption (-3,172), disrespect (-2,323), other school"
"violations (-1,268), bullying (-1,201) obscene language/gestures (-1,160), and minor"
"insubordinations (-1,033)."
Incidents that were reported in 2009-2010 in comparison with incidents reported in 2008-
"2009 show an increase in incidents of defiance (+1,787), cellular phones (+952),"
"inappropriate personal property (+130), possession of obscene/disruptive literature +129)"
and drug use possession or sales/distribution of Schedule I or II (+122).
"Nationally and throughout Virginia, school personnel, parents, and the public express"
concern about students’ classroom conduct and academic achievement. Traditional
"approaches to student discipline have had mixed results reducing disruptive behavior,"
"vandalism, or the drop-out rate. The Board has expressed its interest in a discipline"
program called Effective Schoolwide Discipline. Over 20 years of classroom research
supports Effective Schoolwide Discipline (ESD/PBIS) as a proven effective way to not
"only improve student behavior, but also to improve academic performance. Reductions"
in disciplinary consequences have increased the amount of time for classroom instruction.
