•,"Promoting high-quality preschool programs is important. Almost 16,000 children are"
,"now served by the Virginia Preschool Initiative (VPI); however, almost 6,700 more"
,"eligible children are not served. In terms of literacy skills, attending a VPI program"
,showed a beneficial association for all students. This effect is maintained through first
,"grade for blacks and Hispanics, and students with disabilities. 17 Thus, increasing the"
,number of children served by the VPI program is of critical importance to preparing
,Virginia’s students for success early in their school years.
•,A high priority for the public schools is dealing effectively with the realities of
,schooling for some children who face difficult personal circumstances such as high
,"poverty, high crime in their neighborhoods, high rates of unhealthy behaviors, poor"
,"nutrition, and other circumstances that obstruct their learning at school. The Board"
,"must help local divisions by providing solid, workable guidelines and policies to"
,assist those who are being tripped up by factors that go beyond the school doors.
•,Attracting the best and the brightest individuals into the teaching profession is a high
,priority. Finding and retaining qualified teachers in chronic shortage areas have been
,persistent problems for many local divisions. Shortage areas include special
,"education, mathematics, some foreign languages, and teachers of English as a Second"
,"Language. Of particular concern, too, is recruiting and retaining teachers for STEM"
,programs.
•,"As schools implement more rigorous standards and tests in English and mathematics,"
,"starting with mathematics this year and followed by English during 2012-2013, there"
,may be further declines in accreditation. As more rigorous standards and assessments
,"become effective, a new trend line will begin, but we must not become alarmed or"
,discouraged. We must not give into temptation to preserve the status quo. Raising
,"standards is the right thing to do, and our teachers and schools will rise to the"
,challenge. Virginia students will be better prepared as a result.
