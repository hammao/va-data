APPENDIX A:
Compliance with the Standards of Quality: 2010-2011
One hundred-four divisions (78%) reported full compliance with the provisions of the
Standards of Quality (SOQ) in the 2010-2011 school year. Appendix B contains a list of
school divisions that have reported non-compliance with any of the provisions of the
SOQ. The appendix also provides additional information on the status of compliance
over the last three years for these divisions.
Section 22.1-18 of the Code of Virginia requires the Board of Education to “identify any
school divisions and the specific schools therein which have failed to establish and
"maintain schools meeting the existing prescribed standards of quality.” Each year, the"
Department of Education collects self-assessment data from school divisions on their
compliance with the provisions of § 22.1-253.13:1 through 22.1-253.13:8 of the Code of
Virginia (Standards of Quality). The chairman of the school board and division
superintendent certify the level of compliance with the standards and the individual
indicators within each standard to the Department of Education via an electronic data
collection system.
"Where divisions indicate less than full compliance with the standards, corrective action"
plans for the noncompliance items are required. Of the divisions that were not in full
"compliance, all have filed a corrective action plan. The data are for the 2010-2011 school"
"year and for the Standards of Quality that were in effect as of July 1, 2010."
