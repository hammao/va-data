The annual Provider Monitoring Report requires providers to supply updates and changes to their programs
using the online process (see Appendix B). (NOTE: Much of this form will be generated online based on
the original application by the provider and is not shown in Appendix B). The oversight committee will use
the Application Review Rubric (Appendix A) to evaluate the information about program changes as well as
information collected from stakeholder surveys and statistical data related to course completion and student
growth and achievement. The oversight committee will make a recommendation within 30 business days.
"Based on the recommendation of the oversight committee, a decision regarding the continued approval of"
multidivision online providers will be made by the Superintendent of Public Instruction within 15 business
days of receipt of the monitoring report. The applicants will be notified of their status via a letter sent by
the U.S. Postal Service within 45 business days of the end of the monitoring report period.
A multidivision online provider who no longer meets the Criteria for Approving Multidivision Online
Providers is placed on provisional status (they may continue to serve Virginia students currently enrolled in
the multidivision online program but cannot enroll new students or enter into new multidivision online
provider contracts) and must address the concerns of the oversight committee and the Superintendent of
Public Instruction within 40 business days of receipt of notification. If the provider does not address the
"concerns to the satisfaction of the Superintendent of Public Instruction, the approval status of the provider"
"may be revoked at the end of the academic year or provisional status may be extended; however,"
provisional status will not be extended past the full review date.
Revocation Process for Multidivision Online Providers
The approval of a multidivision online provider will remain in effect until the approval is revoked for
"cause, pursuant to section § 22.1-212.24 of the Code of Virginia. The decision regarding revocation of a"
previously approved multidivision online provider will be made by the Superintendent of Public Instruction
based on the oversight committee’s report and recommendation during the monitoring process.
Revocation notices will be made by certified mail within five business days after the decision has been
made.
"If the Superintendent of Public Instruction has revoked a provider’s approval, the applicant may appeal, in"
"writing, to the Virginia Board of Education within 30 business days of the date the revocation letter is"
mailed. The Board of Education will review the appeal within 60 business days of the date the appeal is
received—or at the next public meeting if none takes place within 60 days of receiving the appeal. The
final decision of the Board of Education will be sent by letter to the individual submitting the appeal. This
decision of the Board of Education is intended to be a final “case decision” within the meaning of the
"Virginia Administrative Process Act (APA) § 2.2-4000 et seq. of the Code of Virginia, and subject to further"
review in accordance with the APA and Part 2A of the Supreme Court of Virginia. The APA details the
authority of state agencies to make decisions based on regulations and explains the standard procedures to
be used.
If a provider’s approval is revoked by the Superintendent of Public Instruction and upheld by the Board of
"Education, the applicant may submit a new application during the next application period."
