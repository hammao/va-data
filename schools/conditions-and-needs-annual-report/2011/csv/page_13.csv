Goal 4: Strong Literacy and Mathematics Skills
The Board of Education will establish policies that support the attainment of literacy and mathematics skills for all
"students, pre-K through grade 12."
Major Policy Decisions to Address Goal 4:
The Board’s policy actions include revising Virginia’s textbook review process; adopting the process for state approval
of textbooks for K-12 English/Language Arts and K-12 Science; adopting the list of state-approved textbooks for K-12
mathematics; adopting Guidelines for Local Textbook Approval; and reaffirming its support for College and Career
Ready Standard.
Actions to Meet the Goal:
College and Career Readiness Initiative (CCRI): The Virginia College and Career Readiness Initiative builds on the
"revised standards and is designed to: a) ensure that college and career ready learning standards in reading, writing, and"
mathematics are taught in every Virginia high school classroom; and b) strengthen students’ preparation for college
and the work force before leaving high school.
Virginia Index of Performance: The recent revision made by the Board added components that provide additional
incentives for school divisions and schools to promote student achievement in the STEM areas and college and career
readiness in general. The revisions also increased the importance of foreign language instruction in elementary
schools.
"Textbook Review and Selection Procedures: In 2011, the Virginia Board of Education approved a revised and"
strengthened textbook approval process. The new process places primary responsibility on publishers to ensure the
accuracy of their textbooks. It is the Board’s intent to incorporate the procedures to regulations as soon as possible.
Helping Students Meet Academic Standards: Current programs that have helped students meet and exceed existing
standards include the Virginia Preschool Initiative; K-3 Class Size Reduction; At-Risk Add-on; SOQ English as a
Second Language programs; Early Intervention Reading Initiative; the Algebra Readiness Initiative; Project
"Graduation; Remedial Summer School; SOQ Prevention, Intervention, and Remediation; and the Regional Alternative"
Education Programs.
What the Data Show:
Increased Rigor: The most recent SOL revisions (2009 and 2010) led to more rigorous content standards that are
"supported as college and career ready by nationally recognized organizations, the College Board, ACT, and Achieve."
New end-of-course mathematics assessments will be implemented in 2011-2012 and new reading and writing
"assessments will be implemented in 2012-2013. The new assessments will be administered online, and include"
technology-enhanced items that require students to demonstrate content mastery in ways that were not possible with
multiple-choice tests.
Increased Proficiency in Mathematics: The percentage of grade-8 students who met or exceeded the rigorous NAEP
"standard for proficiency increased by a statistically significant four points to 40 percent in 2011, compared with 36"
percent in 2009 when the national tests were last administered. Forty-six percent of Virginia fourth-grade students
scored proficient or above in mathematics — six points higher than the percentage nationwide and a three-point
increase since 2009.
What Remains to be Done to Accomplish Goal 4:
"For the College and Career Ready Initiative to be successful, educators must have access to and participate in"
appropriate professional development. The Virginia Department of Education has identified existing funds that allow
the agency to work with our partners—such as institutions of higher education—to develop and implement high
quality professional development to support local educators and to implement the revised mathematics and English
"Standards of Learning. In the next few years, as new resources are limited, continued emphasis on programs for at-risk"
"students will be even more critical for Virginia’s students, as the more rigorous standards are put in place and tested."
"As schools implement more rigorous standards and tests in English and mathematics, starting with mathematics this"
"year and followed by English during 2012-2013, there may be further declines in accreditation."
