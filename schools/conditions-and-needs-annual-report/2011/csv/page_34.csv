The percentage of eighth graders achieving at the advanced level in mathematics rose
"three points, to 11 percent, which also represents a statistically significant improvement"
in performance since 2009. The average mathematics score for Virginia students in grade
"8 increased by three points to 289, compared with the national public school average of"
"283. Since 2005, the average score of Virginia eighth graders has increased a statistically"
significant five points.
Superintendent of Public Instruction Patricia I. Wright attributed the gains to revisions in
Virginia’s Standards of Learning (SOL) program. The 2011 NAEP results confirm the
gains we have already seen on middle school and Algebra I SOL tests. The mathematics
SOL tests students take in spring 2012 will be based on the new standards.
Forty-six percent of Virginia fourth-grade students scored proficient or above in
mathematics — six points higher than the percentage nationwide and a three-point
"increase since 2009. Since 2005, the percentage of Virginia fourth graders achieving at"
proficient or above has risen by a statistically significant seven points. The percentage of
fourth graders achieving at the advanced level in mathematics rose from seven percent in
"2009, to nine percent. A three-point increase in advanced achievement on the fourth"
grade mathematics test since 2005 is regarded as significant.
"The average mathematics score of Virginia fourth graders was 245, a statistically"
"significant five points higher than the national average of 240, and a two-point increase in"
fourth grade mathematics achievement since 2009. The average score of Virginia fourth
graders has increased a statistically significant five points since 2005.
