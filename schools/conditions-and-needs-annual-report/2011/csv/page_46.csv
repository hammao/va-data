Performance Measures for Goal 4: What the Data Show
"The CCRI builds on 15 years of establishing, implementing, and revising learning"
standards and assessment-based accountability. Rigorous content standards were
"developed and implemented in the 1990s; tests are in place for mathematics, English,"
"science, and history and social science. The Board of Education revised the mathematics"
and English standards twice since implementation. The most recent revisions (2009 and
2010) led to more rigorous content standards that are supported as college and career
"ready by nationally recognized organizations, the College Board, ACT, and Achieve."
"In addition to increased rigor, we also see more middle school students enrolled in"
Algebra I or higher courses. This year the percent of middle school students enrolled in
"Algebra I or higher was 48.8 percent of students, an increase of 3.9 percent from 2009-"
"2010, and a 9.4 percent increase over the last three years."
Virginia is developing new SOL assessments that align to the revised mathematics and
"English Standards of Learning adopted in 2009 and 2010, respectively. New end-of-"
course mathematics assessments will be implemented in 2011-2012 and new reading and
writing assessments will be implemented in 2012-2013. The new assessments will be
"administered online, and include technology-enhanced items that require students to"
demonstrate content mastery in ways that were not possible with multiple-choice tests.
The result of the standards revision will be that students will have to demonstrate mastery
"of more rigorous content in order to pass the revised SOL tests. On relevant tests, the"
college ready score will replace the current advanced proficient score.
The Needs of Public Schools:
What Remains to be Done to Accomplish Goal 4
"For the CCRI to be successful, educators must have access to and participate in"
appropriate professional development. The Virginia Department of Education has
identified existing funds that allow the agency to work with our partners—such as
institutions of higher education—to develop and implement high quality professional
development to support local educators and to implement the revised mathematics and
English Standards of Learning.
"In the next few years, as new resources are limited, continued emphasis on programs for"
"at-risk students will be even more critical for Virginia’s students, as the more rigorous"
standards are put in place and tested.
