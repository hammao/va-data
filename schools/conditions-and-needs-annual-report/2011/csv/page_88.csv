Appendix F: Information on Rebenchmarking State Basic Aid
State funding for K-12 education in Virginia represents one-third of the state general fund (GF)
"budget and is its largest portion. State K-12 funding in FY12 is $5.5 billion, mostly from GFs"
"but also other state sources. From FY02 to FY12, state K-12 funding increased 37 percent while"
enrollment increased only 6.5 percent. Much of the new spending during this time prior to the
recession was to fund increased standards under Virginia’s Standards of Quality.
The Direct Aid to Public Education budget provides state funding to school divisions for
"prekindergarten-12 educational programs. In each odd-numbered year, the cost of the Direct Aid"
to Public Education budget is rebenchmarked for the next biennium. The rebenchmarked budget
represents the state cost of continuing the existing Direct Aid to Public Education programs with
biennial updates in the input data used to determine the cost of the programs.
