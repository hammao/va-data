"monitoring process. The application window was open for 30 days, beginning on"
"February 1, 2011. During that time, 14 organizations submitted applications and course"
"correlation documents. After a thorough review, 13 of these organizations were approved"
to offer online instruction as multidivision online providers. For the one rejected
"application, review teams noted significant deficiencies in policy, pupil performance"
"standards, Section 508 compliance, teacher licensure requirements, and correlation to the"
SOL. Please see Appendix G for the full report on multidivision online providers.
Compliance with the Standards of Quality
One hundred-four divisions (listed in Appendices A and B) reported full compliance with
the provisions of the Standards of Quality (SOQ) in the 2010-2011 school year. Last
"year, ninety-four divisions reported full compliance. Appendix B contains a list of school"
divisions that reported noncompliance with certain provisions of the SOQ.
"As in previous years, the standard that shows the most divisions in noncompliance is"
"Standard 3: Accreditation, other standards and evaluation. Thirteen divisions reported"
"noncompliance because not all schools in the division were fully accredited, as required"
"by the SOQ. Twelve divisions reported noncompliance with Standard 2: Instructional,"
"administrative, and support personnel because each had teachers teaching in classes"
outside of their endorsement areas.
Compliance with the Standards of Accreditation
"Ninety-six percent of Virginia’s 1,838 public schools are fully accredited and meeting all"
"state standards for achievement in English, mathematics, history and science—and"
"graduation, in the case of high schools. Ninety-eight percent of Virginia’s elementary"
schools and 97 percent of middle schools are fully accredited for the 2011-2012 school
"year, based on the performance of students on Standards of Learning (SOL) and other"
state assessments during 2010-2011. Schools failing to meet the accreditation
requirements are listed in Appendix C.
"The percentage of fully accredited high schools dropped to 86 percent, compared with 99"
"percent last year, as the Board of Education introduced a “graduation and completion"
"index” as a new accountability factor for high schools, in addition to student achievement"
on state tests. The index system awards full credit for students who earn a board-
recognized diploma and partial credit for students who earn General Education Diplomas
"(GEDs) and local credentials, as well as for students who are still enrolled and expected"
to return for a fifth year of high school. High schools must have a graduation and
completion index of at least 85 for full accreditation.
