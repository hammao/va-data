Issues and Challenges,
"During the implementation, several challenges emerged:",
•,"Some of the providers’ course names were not the same as those used in the SOL; for example, a provider’s"
,"World Literature II course was comparable to the English Grade 10 SOL. In addition, the providers were"
,"allowed to offer elective courses that did not correlate to any standard, which also caused confusion; for"
,"example, one provider’s Algebra I course correlated with the SOL, while another’s elective Algebra I"
,course did not fully correlate.
•,Multidivision online providers were allowed to revise and resubmit course correlation documentation at
,any time after the application window closed. This decision was made because of logistical challenges
,"related to the tight deadline and to ensure the highest quality submissions. This resulted, however, in a"
,continuous review of provider content.
•,The Department of Education originally required multidivision online providers to provide teacher and
,"administrator licensure information at the time of application; however, the providers would not employ"
,"and assign teachers until enough students had registered for the courses. As a result, the rule was revised,"
,allowing providers to submit teacher credentials once they were confident that the course had sufficient
,enrollment to be offered.
•,Providers and school divisions were confused about what constitutes a multidivision online provider as
,"compared to a provider of online content taught by a local teacher. To address this problem, the Department"
,of Education issued clarification and provided training to assist divisions in reporting data correctly.
•,The definitions of “full-time” and “part-time” students need to be clarified. This issue has made it difficult
,to design data collection processes.
