"E. From such funds as may be appropriated or otherwise received for such purpose, there shall be established within the"
Department of Education a unit to (i) conduct evaluative studies; (ii) provide the resources and technical assistance to increase
the capacity for school divisions to deliver quality instruction; and (iii) assist school divisions in implementing those programs
and practices that will enhance pupil academic performance and improve family and community involvement in the public
schools. Such unit shall identify and analyze effective instructional programs and practices and professional development
initiatives; evaluate the success of programs encouraging parental and family involvement; assess changes in student outcomes
prompted by family involvement; and collect and disseminate among school divisions information regarding effective
"instructional programs and practices, initiatives promoting family and community involvement, and potential funding and support"
sources. Such unit may also provide resources supporting professional development for administrators and teachers. In providing
"such information, resources, and other services to school divisions, the unit shall give priority to those divisions demonstrating a"
less than 70 percent passing rate on the Standards of Learning assessments.
"§ 22.1-253.13:2. Standard 2. Instructional, administrative, and support personnel."
"A. The Board shall establish requirements for the licensing of teachers, principals, superintendents, and other professional"
personnel.
B. School boards shall employ licensed instructional personnel qualified in the relevant subject areas.
C. Each school board shall assign licensed instructional personnel in a manner that produces divisionwide ratios of students in
"average daily membership to full-time equivalent teaching positions, excluding special education teachers, principals, assistant"
"principals, counselors, and librarians, that are not greater than the following ratios: (i) 24 to one in kindergarten with no class"
"being larger than 29 students; if the average daily membership in any kindergarten class exceeds 24 pupils, a full-time teacher's"
"aide shall be assigned to the class; (ii) 24 to one in grades one, two, and three with no class being larger than 30 students; (iii) 25"
to one in grades four through six with no class being larger than 35 students; and (iv) 24 to one in English classes in grades six
through 12.
"Within its regulations governing special education programs, the Board shall seek to set pupil/teacher ratios for pupils with"
mental retardation that do not exceed the pupil/teacher ratios for self-contained classes for pupils with specific learning
disabilities.
"Further, school boards shall assign instructional personnel in a manner that produces schoolwide ratios of students in average"
daily memberships to full-time equivalent teaching positions of 21 to one in middle schools and high schools. School divisions
"shall provide all middle and high school teachers with one planning period per day or the equivalent, unencumbered of any"
teaching or supervisory duties.
"D. Each local school board shall employ with state and local basic, special education, gifted, and career and technical education"
"funds a minimum number of licensed, full-time equivalent instructional personnel for each 1,000 students in average daily"
membership (ADM) as set forth in the appropriation act. Calculations of kindergarten positions shall be based on full-day
"kindergarten programs. Beginning with the March 31 report of average daily membership, those school divisions offering half-"
day kindergarten with pupil/teacher ratios that exceed 30 to one shall adjust their average daily membership for kindergarten to
"reflect 85 percent of the total kindergarten average daily memberships, as provided in the appropriation act."
"E. In addition to the positions supported by basic aid and in support of regular school year programs of prevention, intervention,"
"and remediation, state funding, pursuant to the appropriation act, shall be provided to fund certain full-time equivalent"
"instructional positions for each 1,000 students in grades K through 12 who are identified as needing prevention, intervention, and"
"remediation services. State funding for prevention, intervention, and remediation programs provided pursuant to this subsection"
and the appropriation act may be used to support programs for educationally at-risk students as identified by the local school
boards.
"To provide flexibility in the provision of mathematics intervention services, school divisions may use the Standards of Learning"
Algebra Readiness Initiative funding and the required local matching funds to employ mathematics teacher specialists to provide
the required mathematics intervention services. School divisions using the Standards of Learning Algebra Readiness Initiative
funding in this manner shall only employ instructional personnel licensed by the Board of Education.
"F. In addition to the positions supported by basic aid and those in support of regular school year programs of prevention,"
"intervention, and remediation, state funding, pursuant to the appropriation act, shall be provided to support 17 full-time"
"equivalent instructional positions for each 1,000 students identified as having limited English proficiency."
To provide flexibility in the instruction of English language learners who have limited English proficiency and who are at risk of
"not meeting state accountability standards, school divisions may use state and local funds from the Standards of Quality"
"Prevention, Intervention, and Remediation account to employ additional English language learner teachers to provide instruction"
to identified limited English proficiency students. Using these funds in this manner is intended to supplement the instructional
"services provided in this section. School divisions using the SOQ Prevention, Intervention, and Remediation funds in this manner"
shall employ only instructional personnel licensed by the Board of Education.
