"The Standard of Learning requirements, including all related assessments, shall be waived for any student awarded a scholarship"
"under the Brown v. Board of Education Scholarship Program, pursuant to § 30-231.2, who is enrolled in a preparation program"
for the General Education Development (GED) certificate or in an adult basic education program to obtain the high school
diploma.
The Board of Education may adopt special provisions related to the administration and use of any SOL test or tests in a content
area as applied to accreditation ratings for any period during which the SOL content or assessments in that area are being revised
"and phased in. Prior to statewide administration of such tests, the Board of Education shall provide notice to local school boards"
regarding such special provisions.
D. The Board of Education may pursue all available civil remedies pursuant to § 22.1-19.1 or administrative action pursuant to §
22.1-292.1 for breaches in test security and unauthorized alteration of test materials or test results.
"The Board may initiate or cause to be initiated a review or investigation of any alleged breach in security, unauthorized alteration,"
"or improper administration of tests, including the exclusion of students from testing who are required to be assessed, by local"
school board employees responsible for the distribution or administration of the tests.
Records and other information furnished to or prepared by the Board during the conduct of a review or investigation may be
"withheld pursuant to subdivision 12 of § 2.2-3705.3. However, this section shall not prohibit the disclosure of records to (i) a"
local school board or division superintendent for the purpose of permitting such board or superintendent to consider or to take
"personnel action with regard to an employee or (ii) any requester, after the conclusion of a review or investigation, in a form that"
(a) does not reveal the identity of any person making a complaint or supplying information to the Board on a confidential basis
and (b) does not compromise the security of any test mandated by the Board. Any local school board or division superintendent
"receiving such records or other information shall, upon taking personnel action against a relevant employee, place copies of such"
records or information relating to the specific employee in such person's personnel file.
"Notwithstanding any other provision of state law, no test or examination authorized by this section, including the Standards of"
"Learning assessments, shall be released or required to be released as minimum competency tests, if, in the judgment of the Board,"
such release would breach the security of such test or examination or deplete the bank of questions necessary to construct future
secure tests.
"E. With such funds as may be appropriated, the Board of Education may provide, through an agreement with vendors having the"
"technical capacity and expertise to provide computerized tests and assessments, and test construction, analysis, and security, for"
(i) web-based computerized tests and assessments for the evaluation of student progress during and after remediation and (ii) the
development of a remediation item bank directly related to the Standards of Learning.
"F. To assess the educational progress of students as individuals and as groups, each local school board shall require the use of"
"Standards of Learning assessments and other relevant data, such as industry certification and state licensure examinations, to"
evaluate student progress and to determine educational performance. Each local school shall require the administration of
"appropriate assessments to all students for grade levels and courses identified by the Board of Education, which may include"
"criterion-referenced tests, teacher-made tests and alternative assessment instruments and shall include the Standards of Learning"
Assessments and the National Assessment of Educational Progress state-by-state assessment. Each school board shall analyze
"and report annually, in compliance with any criteria that may be established by the Board of Education, the results from the"
"Stanford Achievement Test Series, Ninth Edition (Stanford Nine) assessment, if administered, industry certification"
"examinations, and the Standards of Learning Assessments to the public."
"The Board of Education shall not require administration of the Stanford Achievement Test Series, Ninth Edition (Stanford Nine)"
"assessment, except as may be selected to facilitate compliance with the requirements for home instruction pursuant to § 22.1-"
254.1.
The Board shall include requirements for the reporting of the Standards of Learning assessment scores and averages for each year
as part of the Board's requirements relating to the School Performance Report Card. Such scores shall be disaggregated for each
school by student subgroups on the Virginia assessment program as appropriate and shall be reported to the public within three
months of their receipt. These reports (i) shall be posted on the portion of the Department of Education's website relating to the
"School Performance Report Card, in a format and in a manner that allows year-to-year comparisons, and (ii) may include the"
National Assessment of Educational Progress state-by-state assessment.
G. Each local school division superintendent shall regularly review the division's submission of data and reports required by state
and federal law and regulations to ensure that all information is accurate and submitted in a timely fashion. The Superintendent of
Public Instruction shall provide a list of the required reports and data to division superintendents annually. The status of
compliance with this requirement shall be included in the Board of Education's annual report to the Governor and the General
Assembly as required by § 22.1-18.
