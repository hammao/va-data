Goal 7: Safe and Secure Schools
The Board of Education will provide leadership to create safe and secure school environments.
Major Policy Decisions to Address Goal 7:
"Policy actions include policies on Guidelines for Policies on Concussions in Student-Athletes, Guidelines for the"
"Prevention of Sexual Misconduct and Abuse in Virginia Public Schools, and Elementary School Gun Safety Guidelines"
and Curriculum. Policy actions also include continuing to support Bullying Prevention programs and examination of
data on effective discipline initiatives.
Actions to Meet the Goal:
Guidelines for Interactions between Students and Teachers: The Board of Education adopted Guidelines for the
Prevention of Sexual Misconduct and Abuse in Virginia Public Schools to help school divisions create and implement
"policies and procedures that establish clear and reasonable boundaries for interactions between students and teachers,"
"other school board employees, and adult volunteers."
"Policies on Student-Athlete Concussions: On the student health front, the Board of Education worked with the state’s"
health care leaders and other interested stakeholders to develop guidelines for concussions in student-athletes.
Cyberbullying: The Virginia Department of Education has provided its own research and resources by focusing on the
"use of online, interactive, story-based lessons on various Internet safety issues, including cyberbullying. The resulting"
"research demonstrated that these lessons had a positive impact on the behavior of fourth-grade students. Subsequently,"
this project has been continued using Garfield characters and created in cooperation with the Professor Garfield
Foundation.
The Board has expressed its interest in a discipline program called Effective Schoolwide Discipline as a proven
"effective way to not only improve student behavior, but also to improve academic performance."
What the Data Show:
"Incidents of Crime and Violence in Public Schools Drop: In 2009-2010, there were 41,913 fewer required reporting"
incidents than reported in 2008-2009. Comparison of the most frequently reported incidents shows a decline in
"incidents of attendance, classroom/campus disruption, disrespect, other school violations, bullying, obscene"
"language/gestures, and minor insubordinations. Incidents that show an increase were incidents of defiance, cellular"
"phones, inappropriate personal property, possession of obscene/disruptive literature, and drug use possession or"
sales/distribution of Schedule I or II.
What Remains to be Done to Accomplish Goal 7:
A high priority for the Board is dealing effectively with the realities of schooling for some children who face difficult
"personal circumstances such as high poverty, high crime in their neighborhoods, high rates of unhealthy behaviors,"
"poor nutrition, and other circumstances that obstruct their learning at school. The Board must continue to stress the"
"importance of successful, communitywide partnerships in the development of procedures and policies that most"
"effectively support healthy, safe, orderly and disciplined school environments."
"As more and more research in Internet safety shows, it is clear that bullying behavior and cyberbullying are among the"
most pressing issues involved in keeping public schools and the children in them safe.
"Integral to safe and healthy school environments is parent and family involvement. To do this, schools need to"
promote and enhance cooperative partnerships in which families are allies in the efforts of teachers and schools.
