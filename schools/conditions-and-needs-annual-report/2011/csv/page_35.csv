Reading achievement of Virginia fourth-grade students on the 2011 NAEP was
statistically similar to performance on the 2009 test. The percentage of Virginia fourth-
grade students scoring proficient or above increased from 38 to 39 percent. The
percentage performing at the advanced level increased two points to 11 percent. Since
"2005, advanced reading achievement for Virginia fourth graders is up by a significant"
three points.
"Fourth-grade Virginia students achieved an average score of 226 in reading, which was"
"significantly higher than the average for the nation. Only three states, Massachusetts,"
"New Hampshire and New Jersey, had statistically higher fourth grade reading scores."
"Two years ago, only Massachusetts outperformed Virginia in fourth grade reading. The"
change in the average score of Virginia fourth graders since 2009 — from 227 to 226 in
2011 — is not statistically significant.
The reading performance of Virginia eighth graders was flat compared with achievement
in 2009 and since 2003. Thirty-six percent of Virginia eighth-grade students performed at
"the proficient level or above in reading in 2011, a four-point, but statistically"
"insignificant, increase since 2009. The increase in the percentage of Virginia eighth"
graders reading at the advanced level — from two percent in 2009 to four percent in 2011
— was statistically significant.
