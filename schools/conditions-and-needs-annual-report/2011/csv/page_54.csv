Reductions in disciplinary consequences have increased the amount of time available to
administrators for other duties.
The Needs of Public Schools:
What Remains to be Done to Accomplish Goal 7
A high priority for the Board is dealing effectively with the realities of schooling for
"some children who face difficult personal circumstances such as high poverty, high crime"
"in their neighborhoods, high rates of unhealthy behaviors, poor nutrition, and other"
circumstances that obstruct their learning at school. The Board of Education must help
"school divisions by providing solid, workable guidelines and policies to assist those who"
"are responsible for the health and safety of students and staff while they are at school, on"
"school grounds, on their way to and from school, and involved in school-sponsored"
"activities. The Board must continue to stress the importance of successful,"
communitywide partnerships in the development of procedures and policies that most
"effectively support healthy, safe, orderly and disciplined school environments."
"As more and more research in Internet safety shows, it is clear that cyberbullying is one"
of the most pressing issues involved in keeping public schools and the children in them
safe. The Board of Education has supported the Virginia Department of Education’s
efforts to address this issue with the Guidelines and Resources for Internet Safety in
Schools.
Integral to safe and healthy school environments is parent and family involvement. The
family and the home are both critical education institutions where children begin learning
"long before they start school, and where they spend much of their time after they start"
school. Such involvement is critical if we are to improve the educational achievement of
"Virginia’s students, promote safe and healthy school environments, and eliminate"
"achievement gaps. To do this, schools need to promote and enhance cooperative"
partnerships in which families are allies in the efforts of teachers and schools.
Multidivision Online Providers
"In 2010, the Virginia General Assembly passed legislation authorizing the establishment"
of virtual school programs. The legislation required the Superintendent of Public
Instruction to develop and the Virginia Board of Education to approve criteria for
"approving, monitoring, and, if necessary, revoking the contracts of multidivision"
providers of online courses and virtual school programs. It stipulated that the courses or
programs must meet certain requirements with regard to accreditation and staffing and
that the educational objectives and assessments meet or exceed the Virginia Standards of
Learning (SOL) and Standards of Accreditation.
