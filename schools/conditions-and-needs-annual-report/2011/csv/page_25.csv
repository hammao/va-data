"approved by the Board during the past year, the Department of Education produced and"
"implemented the multidivision online provider application process, including the"
development of Criteria for Approval of Multidivision Online Providers and the
"application, appeal, and monitoring process (see Appendix G)."
Fourteen organizations submitted applications and course correlation documents. After a
"thorough review, 13 of these organizations were approved to offer online instruction as"
"multidivision online providers. For the one rejected application, review teams noted"
"significant deficiencies in policy, pupil performance standards, Section 508 compliance,"
"teacher licensure requirements, and correlation to the SOL."
Reviewing and Updating Standards of Quality
"The Board of Education regularly reviews and revises the Standards of Quality (SOQ),"
"Standards of Accreditation (SOA), and Standards of Learning (SOL). Throughout this"
"process, the Board collects data and information that support its ability to thoughtfully"
and deliberately make revisions that are designed to enhance the quality of the standards
to which Virginia’s students are held.
"In 2011, the Board of Education recommended that flexibility be given to divisions to use"
funds provided in the appropriation act for certain staffing standards related to
"instructional staff in mathematics, limited English proficiency, reading, technology and"
assistant principals. The Board also recommended clarification of the term “support
services.” The Board’s recommendations were subsequently adopted by the 2011 General
Assembly.
Performance Measures for Goal 1: What the Data Show
On-Time Graduation Rate
"Virginia’s on-time high school graduation rate rose one point this year to 86.6 percent,"
and the statewide dropout rate fell 0.6 percent to 7.2 percent. On-time graduation has
"increased by 4.5 points since 2008, the first year the Virginia Department of Education"
"(VDOE) reported graduation rates for the state, school divisions and high schools based"
"on student-level data that fully account for student mobility, promotion and retention. A"
"one-point increase in the graduation rate means that nearly 1,000 more young Virginians"
are beginning their adult lives with the diploma they need to pursue further education and
training or an entry-level job.
"Virginia’s federal graduation indicator, which just includes the Standard and Advanced"
"Studies Diploma, rose 1.7 percent to 81.6 percent for all students. Additional information"
on graduation rates may be viewed in Appendix H.
High schools must now meet an annual benchmark for graduation and completion to earn
full accreditation under Virginia's Standards of Learning (SOL) accountability program.
Schools receive full credit for students who earn diplomas and partial credit for students
"who remain enrolled, earn GEDs or otherwise complete high school. The ratings"
announced last month were the first to include this new accountability factor for high
schools.
