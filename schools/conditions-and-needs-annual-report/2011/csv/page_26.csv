"New data for the class of 2010 show that 1,176 students returned for a fifth year of high"
school and earned diplomas. Their achievement resulted in a five-year graduation rate for
"the class of 2010 of 87 percent compared with a four-year, on-time rate of 85.5 percent."
Gap in Graduation Rate for Student Subgroups: Improving But Persistent
"In 2011 compared to 2010, the rate for black students increased 1.4 points to 80.3"
"percent, and on-time graduation for Hispanic students increased 3 points to 79.1 percent."
"The on-time graduation rate for black students has risen 6.3 points, and the rate for"
"Hispanic students has risen by 7.9 points since 2008, the first year cohort graduation rates"
"were reported. For economically disadvantaged students, the rate has risen by 9.3 percent"
during that time period.
"Nonetheless, a gap in the graduation rate of subgroups of students is a problem that has"
"persisted in time, as shown in the following table. Economically disadvantaged students"
and minority students are less likely than all students to graduate in four years. There is a
"6-, 7-, and 6-point achievement gap for black, Hispanic, and economically disadvantaged"
"students, respectively, compared to the overall graduation rate."
