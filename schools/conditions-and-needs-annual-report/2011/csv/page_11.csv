Goal 2: Accountability of Student Learning: The Board of Education will support accountability for all public schools
by providing leadership and by establishing policies that help schools and school divisions increase the academic success
"of all students, especially those who are at-risk or in underperforming school systems. Using improved longitudinal data"
"systems, the Board will monitor schools’ progress in closing achievement gaps among groups of students."
Major Policy Decisions to Address Goal 2: Policy actions include adopting a supplement to the Curriculum Framework for
the 2009 Mathematics Standards of Learning to fully align with national and international standards; criteria for the Virginia
"Index of Performance to promote student achievement in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); new"
"cut scores for History and Social Science Standards of Learning tests in Virginia Studies, U. S. History; the Virginia Grade"
"Level Alternative (VGLA), and the Virginia Alternate Assessment Program; and modifying the Academic Review Process for"
low performing high schools.
Major Actions to Implement Policies for Goal 2:
"New Ways of Assessing Student Progress: New mathematics, English, and science assessments will be administered primarily"
"online, and will include technology-enhanced items that require students to demonstrate content mastery in ways that were not"
"possible with multiple-choice tests, enabling the Board to establish new and challenging cut scores as a part of the Virginia"
College and Career Readiness Initiative.
"Growth Measures: Virginia’s growth measure, currently under development, will provide information about student progress"
relative to other students with similar achievement the previous year.
Requirements Will Become More Rigorous: Students will take more rigorous Standards of Learning mathematics tests
"beginning in 2011-2012 and more rigorous tests in reading, writing, and science the following year."
What the Data Showed:
Important National Comparisons: Results from the 2011 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) show that
Virginia public school students continue to rank among the nation’s highest achievers in reading and mathematics and
"outperform their peers nationwide, and Virginia now ranks among the top on Advanced Placement Results. Virginia now"
ranks third in the nation in achievement on Advanced Placement (AP) examinations. Only Maryland and New York had
"higher percentages. Nonetheless, disparities among subgroups remain. For example, NAEP results show that that black and"
Hispanic students trail their white peers by more than 22 test-score points on the reading assessments at 4th and 8th
"grades. In mathematics, NAEP results at the 4th and 8th grades show, respectively, a 22- and 29- test-score point"
difference between black students and their white peers.
"Students Earning Industry Credentials Increased: In 2011, students passed more than 36,000 industry certification,"
"occupational competency, or workplace readiness exams, or achieved state licensure in areas eligible for student-selected"
certified credits.
The Needs of Public Schools: What Remains to be Done To Accomplish Goal 2?
Raising the Rigor of Virginia’s Academic Standards: Virginia's fourth- and eighth-graders perform better in reading and
"mathematics than their peers nationwide; however, less than two-fifths have a solid grasp of reading and less than half have a"
solid grasp of mathematics based on NAEP’s definition of proficiency.
"As schools implement more rigorous standards and tests in English and mathematics, starting with mathematics this year and"
"followed by English during 2012-2013, there may be further declines in accreditation. As more rigorous standards and"
"assessments become effective, a new trend line will begin, but we must not become alarmed or discouraged. We must not give"
into temptation to preserve the status quo. Raising standards is the right thing to do and our teachers and schools will rise to
the challenge and Virginia students will be better prepared as a result.
Virginia and the Nation: Far Behind in International Comparisons: Studies suggest that for Virginia and the nation to remain
"competitive in the global economy, the U.S. is going to need to make substantial gains in mathematics and science"
achievement.
"Eliminating Achievement Gaps: Persistent achievement gaps show up in on-time graduation rates, dropout rates, Standards"
"of Learning test performance, NAEP, SAT, Advanced Studies diploma rates."
