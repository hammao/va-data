"school's total enrollment; guidance counselor staff requirements shall, however, be based on the enrollment at the various school"
"organization levels, i.e., elementary, middle, or high school. The Board of Education may grant waivers from these staffing levels"
upon request from local school boards seeking to implement experimental or innovative programs that are not consistent with
these staffing levels.

class size reduction program shall be identified as such classes. Any classes having waivers to exceed the requirements of this
"subsection shall also be identified. Schools shall be identified; however, the data shall be compiled in a manner to ensure the"
confidentiality of all teacher and pupil identities.
