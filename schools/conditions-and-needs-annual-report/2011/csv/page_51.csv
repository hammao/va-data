The Needs of Public Schools:
What Remains to be Done to Accomplish Goal 6
Develop Realistic Accountability Model
"The need to comply with federal laws, programs, rules, and regulations has led to a"
significant strain on fiscal and staff resources at the state and local levels. Virginia needs
a new model for measuring yearly progress that maintains high expectations for student
"achievement, recognizes growth — overall and by subgroup — and accurately identifies"
schools most in need of improvement.
"In his August 24, 2011, letter to U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, Governor"
McDonnell pointed out the flaws of NCLB and noted that “A model that increasingly
misidentifies schools as low performing and confuses the public about the quality of their
schools does not advance the cause of reform or accountability.” The prescriptive nature
"of the law, most visible in provisions such as Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) and the"
"requirement for all children to be proficient in mathematics and reading by the year 2014,"
"has led to some serious unintended consequences. Only 38 percent of Virginia’s 1,838"
"schools made AYP based on results from the 2010-2011 assessments, compared to 61"
percent of schools that made AYP in the previous year. Only four of Virginia’s 132
"divisions made AYP based on 2010-2011 assessments, compared with 12 divisions that"
made AYP in the previous year. The AYP targets were five points higher (86 percent) in
reading and six points higher in mathematics (85 percent) than the targets for assessments
"taken by students during 2009-2010. As a consequence, 342 schools that made AYP in"
"the previous year, and would have made AYP had the targets not increased, were"
identified as not making AYP.
The number of schools making AYP dropped even though achievement levels on state
tests were little changed during 2010-2011. There are schools that did not make AYP in
"which achievement in reading and mathematics actually increased, but not by enough to"
keep up with the benchmarks. With AYP targets scheduled to increase an additional five
"points in both reading and mathematics for the 2012 assessment cycle, it is anticipated"
that an even greater disproportionate percentage of schools and divisions will be
misidentified as underperforming during the 2012-2013 year. The public is
understandably confused and frustrated by this misleading and unrealistic model of
accountability.
"Raising student achievement is a priority that overrides fiscal difficulties. Virginia, as"
"with most states, is experiencing unprecedented fiscal challenges at both the state and"
"local levels. While funding adequacy and equity must remain a priority, ensuring that"
limited resources are used as effectively as possible is paramount.
Fiscal Challenges
"As the economy and revenues improve, Virginia will have the opportunity to reinvest in"
public K-12 education. While Virginia leaders should look to fund basic operational
"funds to schools where warranted, with a focus on classroom instruction and minimizing"
