"shall be based on the school's total enrollment; guidance counselor staff requirements shall, however, be based on"
"the enrollment at the various school organization levels, i.e., elementary, middle, or high school. The Board of"
Education may grant waivers from these staffing levels upon request from local school boards seeking to implement
experimental or innovative programs that are not consistent with these staffing levels.
"M. School boards shall, however, annually, on or before January 1, report to the public the actual pupil/teacher ratios"
in elementary school classrooms by school for the current school year. Such actual ratios shall include only the
teachers who teach the grade and class on a full-time basis and shall exclude resource personnel. School boards shall
report pupil/teacher ratios that include resource teachers in the same annual report. Any classes funded through the
voluntary kindergarten through third grade class size reduction program shall be identified as such classes. Any
classes having waivers to exceed the requirements of this subsection shall also be identified. Schools shall be
"identified; however, the data shall be compiled in a manner to ensure the confidentiality of all teacher and pupil"
identities.
N. Students enrolled in a public school on a less than full-time basis shall be counted in ADM in the relevant school
division. Students who are either (i) enrolled in a nonpublic school or (ii) receiving home instruction pursuant to §
"22.1-254.1, and who are enrolled in public school on a less than full-time basis in any mathematics, science,"
"English, history, social science, career and technical education, fine arts, foreign language, or health education or"
physical education course shall be counted in the ADM in the relevant school division on a pro rata basis as
provided in the appropriation act. Each such course enrollment by such students shall be counted as 0.25 in the
"ADM; however, no such nonpublic or home school student shall be counted as more than one-half a student for"
purposes of such pro rata calculation. Such calculation shall not include enrollments of such students in any other
public school courses.
O. Each local school board shall provide those support services that are necessary for the efficient and cost-effective
operation and maintenance of its public schools.
"For the purposes of this title, unless the context otherwise requires, ""support services positions"" shall include the"
following:
"1. Executive policy and leadership positions, including school board members, superintendents and assistant"
superintendents;
"2. Fiscal and human resources positions, including fiscal and audit operations;"
