achievement. The percentage of students meeting NAEP’s rigorous standard for proficiency
jumped four points. Then-Board of Education President Kirk Schroder described the 1998 NAEP
results as tangible evidence that Virginia schools were moving in the right direction.
Creating a statewide system of support
"SOL-related initiatives were launched by Allen and his successor, Governor James Gilmore, to"
support schools in their efforts to improve reading skills and identify and assist students at risk of
"not meeting new, more rigorous graduation requirements. These efforts marked the beginning of"
the development of a statewide system of support linked to the standards.
The General Assembly approved the Virginia Early Reading Initiative in 1997 to provide early
"intervention for kindergartners and first graders (in 2000, this Allen-era initiative was expanded"
to include students through grade 3). The initiative included the development of a powerful
diagnostic assessment to enable teachers and reading specialists to identify and correct reading
problems sooner rather than later.
New algebra-related courses and professional development opportunities were developed for
"middle and high school mathematics teachers, and in 2000, the General Assembly approved"
Gilmore’s Algebra Readiness Initiative to support diagnostic and intervention services for
students in grades 6-9 at risk of not passing the Algebra I SOL test.
"During their 2000 session, state lawmakers also approved Gilmore’s SOL Technology Initiative,"
setting Virginia on a course to become a national leader in online assessment. The initiative
"authorized annual grants to school divisions, funded through the issuance of notes by the"
"Virginia Public School Authority, to create the infrastructure and purchase the hardware required"
"for online testing, as well as to increase students’ access to technology. By fall 2001, students in"
15 school divisions were taking at least some SOL tests online.
The 2000 General Assembly also responded to requests from school divisions by directing the
Virginia Department of Education (VDOE) to develop three new course-specific history/social
science tests to administer in grades 5-8 as an alternative to the cumulative grade-8 history/social
science assessment. The cumulative test was ultimately phased out in 2008.
"Also in 2000, VDOE academic review teams began visiting low-performing schools and"
assisting in the development and implementation of improvement plans. The Board of Education
required schools reviewed because of low student achievement in reading and mathematics to
implement instructional programs of proven effectiveness.
"During this same year, the Board of Education revised it accountability regulations to provide"
additional options and flexibility for students in meeting assessment-related diploma
requirements that were scheduled to become effective with the class of 2004. The changes
"included allowing students to substitute Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate and"
other rigorous assessments for end-of-course SOL tests in the same subjects.
Support for students and schools
"After his election in 2001, Governor Mark R. Warner signaled his support for the Standards of"
Learning reform program by re-appointing Jo-Lynne DeMary as superintendent of public
