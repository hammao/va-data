X. Closing Statement by the Virginia Board of Education
"Working with its many partners, the Board of Education will continue developing policies and"
providing leadership that improve student achievement and prepare students to succeed in
postsecondary education and the workplace. Virginia’s excellent statewide system of public
education derives strength from its diversity and ensures equality of opportunity for each student
"in a safe and healthy learning environment that prepares all students to be capable, responsible,"
and self-reliant citizens in the global society.
Achieving the mission of the Board will not be easy. As schools implement more rigorous
"standards and tests, we have witnessed declines in passing rates and school accreditation. Even"
more attention and resources will need to be focused on closing the achievement gaps that persist
"among student subgroups and on chronically underperforming schools. We must not, however,"
become alarmed or discouraged or yield to the temptation to preserve the status quo. Raising
"expectations is the right thing to do, and our teachers and schools will rise to the challenge."
Virginia students will be better prepared as a result.
Current conditions remind us more than ever that the key to economic recovery is a strong
education system. The Board of Education will continue to think creatively and work
"collaboratively to assure that its goals and strategies are relevant, practical, and effective."
