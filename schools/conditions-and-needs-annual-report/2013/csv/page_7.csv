Executive Summary
"In keeping with the statutory mandates, the 2013 Annual Report on the Condition and Needs of"
"the Public Schools in Virginia details the Board of Education's goals, actions taken in alignment"
"with the goals, and analysis of the extent to which they have been met. The 2013 report is based"
"on goals as described in the Board of Education’s Comprehensive Plan: 2012-2017, and results"
obtained in the 2012-2013 school year. This report also contains information on the current
"Standards of Quality (SOQ), compliance with the SOQ and the Standards of Accreditation, a"
"report on charter schools in Virginia, parent and student choice within school divisions, and the"
multidivision online provider report.
Virginia remains a leader in quality education
"The mission of the Board of Education and Superintendent of Public Instruction, in cooperation"
"with their partners, is to develop policies and provide leadership that improve student"
achievement and prepare students to succeed in postsecondary education and the workplace.
"Over the last five years, expectations have been raised through the introduction of more"
rigorous curriculum standards and challenging new Standards of Learning (SOL) assessments
that test students’ problem-solving and critical-thinking skills as well as their content
"knowledge. The benchmark pass rates required for full accreditation have also increased, and"
high schools must meet goals for improving graduation rates.
The term Standards of Learning dates back to the 1980s.What Virginians today regard as the
SOL program began in the mid-1990s in the wake of several ineffective attempts at reform
"plagued by low minimum expectations for all students, limited accountability for student"
learning of content and skills needed to be successful in the twenty-first century. The major
takeaway from these efforts strongly suggests that students must possess twenty-first century
"knowledge beyond the “three Rs” (reading, writing, and arithmetic) and twenty-first century"
"skills to include the “four Cs” (collaboration, communication, creativity, and critical thinking)."
"Today, the focus of the SOL program has shifted to the ambitious but vital goal of college and"
"career readiness for all students. The Board, school divisions, and schools need to remain"
focused on raising the rigor of Virginia’s academic standards to reflect college and career
"readiness, while educating the public about the impact of such changes. An historical overview"
of the Standards of Learning program is included in Appendix A.
The 2012-2013 academic year saw Virginia's public school students make progress in many
"critical areas, including the on-time graduation rate topping 89% and the dropout rate continuing"
to fall. While nationwide public school students’ achievement on the Scholastic Aptitude Test
"(SAT) was flat or declining, Virginia students’ average scores increased across the board and"
showed progress in narrowing achievement gaps. We saw increased Advanced Placement (AP)
"participation and performance by Virginia students, and our students outperformed public school"
graduates nationwide on American College Testing (ACT). Students also posted gains on the
rigorous new SOL mathematics assessments.
"In addition to more rigorous standards and assessments, next year the Virginia Department of"
Education (VDOE) will begin a pilot of Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) in grade 7
"mathematics and grade 8 reading. In CAT, the computer scores the student’s responses to a test"
item and selects the next item based on the student’s response. CAT is iterative in that the
