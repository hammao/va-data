“Most of Virginia’s high school students are meeting or exceeding the Commonwealth’s diploma
standards but we must redouble our efforts to address the issues that historically have caused
"students to dropout or complete high school without earning a diploma,” said Mark E. Emblidge,"
a former Richmond school board chairman who became president of the state board shortly after
Kaine took office.
The board revised the Commonwealth’s accreditation standards to require high schools to meet
an annual benchmark for graduation. This addition to the board’s accountability standards
became effective with accreditation ratings for the 2011-2012 school year and was made possible
by the development in 2008 of a longitudinal student data system that allowed VDOE to
"calculate cohort graduation and dropout rates for schools, divisions and the state."
School divisions began preparing for the new accountability measure by improving student-data
systems and developing new programs to identify and assist students at risk of dropping out.
"In 2008, VDOE reported a statewide four-year graduation rate of 81.3 percent for the class of"
"2008. The following March, VDOE reported a statewide dropout rate of 8.7 percent. By 2013,"
the graduation rate had risen to 89.1 percent and the dropout rate had fallen to 5.9 percent.
Kaine also urged the Board of Education to create a mechanism within the SOL program to
recognize and reward schools and school divisions that far exceed state and federal
accountability standards. The Board responded in 2007 by approving the Virginia Index of
Performance (VIP) incentive program.
Virginia’s progress under the SOL program was recognized by Education Week in its January
2007 Quality Counts report. The report described Virginia students as the most likely to succeed
in the nation and said that the typical student in the Commonwealth “enjoys higher achievement
and is more likely to finish high school and continue on to college than in other states.” Virginia
continues to rank among the top states — most recently fourth — in the annual Quality Counts
report.
The College Board’s 2007 Advanced Placement Report to the Nation provided what Kaine
described as another milestone on Virginia’s journey from “competence to excellence” under the
SOL program as Virginia joined the handful of states in which 20 percent or more of high school
seniors earned a grade of 3 or more on an AP examination. Only three states had higher
percentages of seniors with scores qualifying for college credit.
Virginia fourth and eighth graders achieved significant overall gains in mathematics on the 2007
"NAEP, compared with performance on the national tests two years earlier. And for the first time"
"since the beginning of the national assessment program in the early 1990s, a majority – 60"
percent – of black fourth graders in the Commonwealth demonstrated reading proficiency at or
above the basic level.
"Billy K. Cannaday Jr., who succeeded DeMary as state superintendent, said the improvements"
"made 2007 a “watershed year” for the 12-year-old SOL program. ""Because of the efforts of"
thousands of teachers and other educators – and the Commonwealth's commitment to the
