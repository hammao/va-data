"§ 22.1-253.13:3. Standard 3. Accreditation, other standards, assessments, and releases from state regulations."
A. The Board of Education shall promulgate regulations establishing standards for accreditation pursuant to the
"Administrative Process Act (§ 2.2-4000 et seq.), which shall include, but not be limited to, student outcome"
"measures, requirements and guidelines for instructional programs and for the integration of educational technology"
"into such instructional programs, administrative and instructional staffing levels and positions, including staff"
"positions for supporting educational technology, student services, auxiliary education programs such as library and"
"media services, course and credit requirements for graduation from high school, community relations, and the"
"philosophy, goals, and objectives of public education in Virginia."
The Board of Education shall promulgate regulations establishing standards for accreditation of public virtual
schools under the authority of the local school board that enroll students full time.
The Board shall review annually the accreditation status of all schools in the Commonwealth.
Each local school board shall maintain schools that are fully accredited pursuant to the standards for accreditation as
prescribed by the Board of Education. Each local school board shall review the accreditation status of all schools in
"the local school division annually in public session. Within the time specified by the Board of Education, each"
school board shall submit corrective action plans for any schools within its school division that have been
designated as not meeting the standards as approved by the Board.
When the Board of Education has obtained evidence through the school academic review process that the failure of
schools within a division to achieve full accreditation status is related to division level failure to implement the
"Standards of Quality, the Board may require a division level academic review. After the conduct of such review and"
"within the time specified by the Board of Education, each school board shall submit for approval by the Board a"
"corrective action plan, consistent with criteria established by the Board and setting forth specific actions and a"
schedule designed to ensure that schools within its school division achieve full accreditation status. Such corrective
action plans shall be part of the relevant school division's comprehensive plan pursuant to § 22.1-253.13:6.
"With such funds as are appropriated or otherwise received for this purpose, the Board shall adopt and implement an"
"academic review process, to be conducted by the Department of Education, to assist schools that are accredited with"
"warning. The Department shall forward a report of each academic review to the relevant local school board, and"
such school board shall report the results of such academic review and the required annual progress reports in public
session. The local school board shall implement any actions identified through the academic review and utilize them
for improvement planning.
