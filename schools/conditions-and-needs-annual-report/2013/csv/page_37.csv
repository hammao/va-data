The percentage of Virginia fourth graders meeting or exceeding the NAEP proficiency standard
"in mathematics increased in 2005 to 39 percent (compared with only 19 percent in 1996), and the"
percentage of eighth graders meeting the standard in mathematics increased to 33 percent
(compared with 21 percent in 1996).
Virginia fourth-graders led the nation on the 2005 NAEP in science. Forty percent met or
"exceeded the rigorous NAEP standard for science proficiency, compared with 32 percent five"
"years earlier. Nationwide, only 27 percent of fourth-graders achieved at the proficient level or"
"above. Thirty-five percent of Virginia students in grade 8 met or exceeded the NAEP standard,"
"compared with 29 percent five years earlier. Nationwide, 27 percent of eighth-graders performed"
at the proficient level or above.
The performance of Virginia high school seniors on the SAT also improved significantly in
"2005. The average mathematics score of Virginia public school seniors increased by six points,"
which was the largest increase in mathematics achievement in the nation.
Virginia also was poised to join a select group of states in which 20 percent or more of high
school seniors qualified for college credit by earning a grade of 3 or more on an Advanced
"Placement (AP) examination. During 2005, 19.3 percent of the Commonwealth’s public high"
"school seniors earned a grade of 3 or better on at least one AP test, compared with 15.9 percent"
in 2000. Only four states had a higher percentage of seniors earning grades of 3 or better.
New tests challenge middle schools
"In 2006, new reading and mathematics SOL tests were introduced in grades 4, 6 and 7 to comply"
with the NCLB requirement for annual testing in these subjects in grades 3-8. The new grade-
level assessments represented a significant increase in expectations as students were required to
"demonstrate a deeper mastery of content, especially in math. Mathematics pass rates plunged in"
middle schools across the state. While nine out of 10 schools still earned full accreditation for
"2006-2007, 86 of the state’s 307 middle schools were accredited with warning."
The 2006-2007 school year also was the first to see schools denied accreditation because of
persistently low-achievement on the state tests. Four of the six schools denied accreditation were
in Petersburg and two were in Sussex County. VDOE’s Office of School Improvement began
intensive interventions in these and other low-performing school divisions.
The challenge presented by the more rigorous middle school assessments was met as VDOE and
"school divisions collaborated to develop new resources, especially for mathematics teachers. The"
department invited top middle school mathematics teachers from around the Commonwealth to
participate in the creation of a series of videos illustrating how various concepts and operations
could be effectively presented to diverse learners.
"These resources, and others developed as part of this effort, were distributed to school divisions"
and posted on the VDOE website. The response to the middle school mathematics challenge
created a template for future state-division collaborations.
Expanding accountability and recognizing excellence
"At the start of his administration in 2006, Governor Timothy M. Kaine called on the Board of"
Education to include graduation as an accountability factor in the accreditation of high schools.
