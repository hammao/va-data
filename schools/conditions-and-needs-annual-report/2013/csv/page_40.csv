lawmakers that the transition to more rigorous standards would lead to short-term declines in
pass rates on state tests.
“Our schools will begin a new trend line as these more rigorous standards and benchmarks
"become effective over the next few years,” Wright said. “But we must not become alarmed or"
discouraged. And we must not give in to the temptation to preserve the status quo when we know
in our hearts that we must raise standards for our young people to remain competitive in the 21st
century.”
"Also in January, the National Center for Education statistics released results from revamped"
national science assessments administered in 2009. Virginia fourth graders again led the nation
"in science, with 46 percent meeting or exceeding the NAEP proficiency standard. Thirty-six"
"percent of Virginia eighth graders performed at or above the proficiency level, with students in"
only six states ranking higher.
"By spring 2011, 2.2 million SOL tests were being taken online. Pleased with the growth and"
"success of the online assessment program, the General Assembly mandated that all SOL tests be"
"administered online by spring 2013, except in cases where a student’s disability necessitated a"
paper-and-pencil test.
"In a July 2011 commentary published by the Richmond Times-Dispatch, Wright addressed"
questions about the growth of testing in the Commonwealth’s schools:
Is there too much testing in Virginia’s public schools? Is “test preparation”
crowding out real teaching and learning in some schools? You may be surprised
"that my answer, as one of the architects of the SOL program, is “yes” to both"
questions.
"But in considering the amount of testing, it is important to distinguish between the"
actual SOL tests required by the Commonwealth and the myriad assessments that
local administrators have put in place to identify students at risk of not passing
the SOLs and potentially jeopardizing a school’s accountability rating.
Wright also noted the concerns of Board of Education members that local decisions sometimes
"prevented teachers from weaving SOL content into engaging curriculum, as originally intended"
by the Board. She pointed out that the overemphasis on “test prep” in some divisions was also
counter to research showing that the best way to prepare students is to provide instruction that
exceeds the depth and rigor of the standards.
"Accreditation ratings announced in the fall of 2011 marked an all-time high, despite the"
introduction of new history and social science SOL tests during 2010-2011. Ninety-six percent of
schools were fully accredited and only eight middle schools remained on academic warning.
Additional evidence of the continuing impact of the SOL reform was provided by results from
"the 2011 NAEP. In mathematics, the percentage of grade-8 students who met or exceeded the"
NAEP standard for proficiency increased by four points to 40 percent and the percentage of
fourth-grade students at or above proficiency rose three points to 46 percent.
