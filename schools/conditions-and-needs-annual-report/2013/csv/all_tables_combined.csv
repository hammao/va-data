Executive Summary
"In keeping with the statutory mandates, the 2013 Annual Report on the Condition and Needs of"
"the Public Schools in Virginia details the Board of Education's goals, actions taken in alignment"
"with the goals, and analysis of the extent to which they have been met. The 2013 report is based"
"on goals as described in the Board of Education’s Comprehensive Plan: 2012-2017, and results"
obtained in the 2012-2013 school year. This report also contains information on the current
"Standards of Quality (SOQ), compliance with the SOQ and the Standards of Accreditation, a"
"report on charter schools in Virginia, parent and student choice within school divisions, and the"
multidivision online provider report.
Virginia remains a leader in quality education
"The mission of the Board of Education and Superintendent of Public Instruction, in cooperation"
"with their partners, is to develop policies and provide leadership that improve student"
achievement and prepare students to succeed in postsecondary education and the workplace.
"Over the last five years, expectations have been raised through the introduction of more"
rigorous curriculum standards and challenging new Standards of Learning (SOL) assessments
that test students’ problem-solving and critical-thinking skills as well as their content
"knowledge. The benchmark pass rates required for full accreditation have also increased, and"
high schools must meet goals for improving graduation rates.
The term Standards of Learning dates back to the 1980s.What Virginians today regard as the
SOL program began in the mid-1990s in the wake of several ineffective attempts at reform
"plagued by low minimum expectations for all students, limited accountability for student"
learning of content and skills needed to be successful in the twenty-first century. The major
takeaway from these efforts strongly suggests that students must possess twenty-first century
"knowledge beyond the “three Rs” (reading, writing, and arithmetic) and twenty-first century"
"skills to include the “four Cs” (collaboration, communication, creativity, and critical thinking)."
"Today, the focus of the SOL program has shifted to the ambitious but vital goal of college and"
"career readiness for all students. The Board, school divisions, and schools need to remain"
focused on raising the rigor of Virginia’s academic standards to reflect college and career
"readiness, while educating the public about the impact of such changes. An historical overview"
of the Standards of Learning program is included in Appendix A.
The 2012-2013 academic year saw Virginia's public school students make progress in many
"critical areas, including the on-time graduation rate topping 89% and the dropout rate continuing"
to fall. While nationwide public school students’ achievement on the Scholastic Aptitude Test
"(SAT) was flat or declining, Virginia students’ average scores increased across the board and"
showed progress in narrowing achievement gaps. We saw increased Advanced Placement (AP)
"participation and performance by Virginia students, and our students outperformed public school"
graduates nationwide on American College Testing (ACT). Students also posted gains on the
rigorous new SOL mathematics assessments.
"In addition to more rigorous standards and assessments, next year the Virginia Department of"
Education (VDOE) will begin a pilot of Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) in grade 7
"mathematics and grade 8 reading. In CAT, the computer scores the student’s responses to a test"
item and selects the next item based on the student’s response. CAT is iterative in that the

and needs facing K-12 public education in Virginia. The overarching issues that need to be,and needs facing K-12 public education in Virginia. The overarching issues that need to be
addressed are:,addressed are:
,"Persistent achievement gaps among groups of students - Family income, race, disabilities,"
,"language proficiency, and other demographic factors remain too strong an indicator of"
,"passing rates on tests, high school graduation rates, and other measures of academic"
,success.
,Chronically underperforming schools - A small but significant number of schools remain
,chronically low-performing by state and federal standards. Improving these schools and
,"better serving the children who attend them will require focus, perseverance, resources,"
,and teamwork.
,Professionalism of the teaching profession - Attracting the best and the brightest
,"individuals into the teaching profession, supporting their continued professional"
,"development, boosting morale, and retaining those who excel is of critical importance to"
,student achievement.
"In addition to the issues discussed above, the Board has identified the following areas of need:","In addition to the issues discussed above, the Board has identified the following areas of need:"
,"Over the last five years, the accreditation bar has been raised through the introduction of"
,more rigorous curriculum standards and challenging new assessments that test students’
,problem-solving and critical-thinking skills as well as their content knowledge. In
,"addition, the benchmark pass rates required for full accreditation have increased, and"
,high schools must meet goals for improving graduation rates. The focus of the SOL
,program has shifted to the ambitious but vital goal of college and career readiness for all
,students. Temporary declines in SOL scores and accreditation ratings are signs that the
,"Commonwealth is expecting more, not that students are learning less. The Board, school"
,"divisions, and schools need to remain focused on raising the rigor of Virginia’s"
,"academic standards to reflect college and career readiness, while educating the public"
,about the impact of such changes. An historical overview of the Standards of Learning
,program is included in Appendix A.
,"Continued investment of resources is integral to improving student performance,"
,especially given the high expectations reflected in increasingly rigorous SOL tests and
,efforts to close achievement gaps among demographic groups. Many local school
,systems face declining resources as a result of the recession and find it difficult to serve
,"high percentages of students who are from low-income backgrounds, or who have"
,"limited English proficiency. While resources are declining in many localities,"
,expectations continue to increase for all students.
,"The Board will monitor the implementation and effects of new policies, including growth"
,"indicators and the A-F school grading formula, to assure the policies are fair, transparent,"
,and accurate. Many Board members expressed concern that the necessary data was not
,available during the timeline provided by the General Assembly for the Board to fully
,"consider the impact of the A-F grading system, given the implementation of rigorous new"
,SOL mathematics tests in 2011-2012 and science and reading tests in 2012-2013. The
,Board will monitor and reevaluate the policies to consider unintended consequences and
,refine such policies as needed.
,"It remains important to set high academic expectations for students with disabilities, but"
,20
,also support individualized curriculum to result in appropriate employment and
,independent living skills for students who do not pursue postsecondary education. The
,Board will continue to support the need to address transition issues as early as possible
,across all areas in a student with disabilities’ school career.
,There is some concern about ambiguity in the Standards of Quality as it relates to class
,"size. The SOQ, as written in the Code of Virginia, does not provide guidance on"
,questions such as the definition of “class” and when students must be counted. The Board
,plans to consider guidance to help school divisions interpret and the Department and
,Board to enforce class size provisions.
,The Code of Virginia allows a substitute to serve for up to 90 teaching days in a teacher
,vacancy (or more if approved by the Superintendent of Public Instruction on a case-by-
,case basis) during one school year. The Board expressed concern regarding the length of
,"time a substitute may serve in a vacancy, given that substitute teachers are not required to"
,hold a license.
,The Board supports reform of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965
,(ESEA) that respects state authority for public education while ensuring policies are
,implemented at the state and local levels that address closing achievement gaps. The
,Board will also continue to seek flexibility from ESEA through a renewal of its waiver of
,certain requirements under the “No Child Left Behind” Act.
,Recognizing the reality that our graduates must compete successfully in a global
,"economy, the Board continues to identify cost-effective ways to measure the"
,achievements of Virginia students on recognized international benchmarks. The state
,accountability system lacks sufficient data to benchmark the performance of its students
,on international tests such as the Programme for International Student Assessment
,(PISA) and the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS). The
,"Board would like to participate in obtaining state-level results from the 2015 PISA, which"
,"would require an appropriation of $600,000 in the next biennial budget."
,The Board’s role in promoting high-quality preschool programs and increasing the
,"number of children served by such programs is limited, but the Board remains dedicated"
,"to nurturing young learners and supportive of the Department’s efforts in this area, as"
,noted in goal four.
,"Many children still face difficult personal circumstances such as high poverty, high crime"
,"in their neighborhoods, lack of parental support, limited English proficiency and other"
,"circumstances that obstruct their learning at school. For instance, the percent of students"
,eligible for free and reduced-price meals has grown from 34.6 percent in 2008-2009 to
,"40.2 percent in 2012-2013. Further, childhood hunger and childhood obesity remain"
,"critical issues for many. High rates of unhealthy behaviors, hunger, and poor nutrition"
,keep some students from focusing on learning.
,Maintaining the capacity of the VDOE staff to implement the constitutional and statutory
,requirements placed on the Board of Education and the Department of Education
,"continues to be a challenge with thin resources, particularly in keeping up with"
,increasingly burdensome and time-consuming federal reporting and accountability
,"requirements. A recent study, “State Education Agencies as Agents of Change,” co-"
,"published by the Center for American Progress and the American Enterprise Institute,"
,reported Virginia’s Department of Education staff to pupil ratio as the third lowest in the
,nation. Maintaining high expectations and turning around low-performing schools will
,"require a strong, well-funded VDOE presence."
,21
,The ability of VDOE staff to review and the Board to approve textbooks and instructional
,materials in the digital age is a concern as textbooks and instructional materials are
,"changing at rapid pace, which requires increased time and resources for state-level"
,review.

,"are troubling. Citizens also discussed the impact of home-life circumstances, such as"
,"poverty, hunger, or abuse, on a child’s learning."

,k-12 education amid increasing expectations and challenging demographics.
,"Difficulty recruiting and retaining highly effective teachers, especially in hard-to-staff"

After reviewing data from these reports and conducting monitoring interviews with the
"providers, the Department of Education has identified three primary issues of concern: some"
"approved providers are offering courses that have not been approved, some school divisions are"
not providing information on their Web sites about the approved multidivision online provider
"courses, and discrepancies exist between data submitted by providers and data reported in the"
Student Records Collection (SRC). These issues are detailed in the report in Appendix F.
IX. Virtual Virginia Overview
"As a program of the Virginia Department of Education, Virtual Virginia offers online Advanced"
"Placement (AP®), world language, core academic, and elective courses to students across the"
"Commonwealth and nation. Virtual Virginia is committed to providing high-quality, rigorous"
course content with flexibility to meet the varied schedules of schools and students. The Virtual
Virginia program strives to provide instruction that meets the individual needs of students.
Virtual Virginia works with Virginia public schools to provide students access to courses that are
"unavailable to them due to low enrollments, scheduling conflicts, and the lack of highly qualified"
teachers. Virtual Virginia ensures the availability of high quality and rigorous Advanced
Placement and world language courses to underserved populations and provides equity of access
to educational options throughout Virginia.
"Courses are delivered via the Internet through a secure, Web-based environment; students may"
participate at school or at home. The courses promote a high level of interaction among students
"and teachers. The content is media-rich, interactive, and engaging and is designed to address"
"different learning styles. The courses contain readings, discussion forums, written assignments,"
"various forms of media, student presentations and projects, case studies, simulations, virtual lab"
"assignments, models, interactivities, and opportunities for collaboration."
Virtual Virginia courses meet and exceed Virginia’s Standards of Learning. All Advanced
Placement courses are audited and approved by the College Board as well as the National
Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). The course completion rate for 2012-13 was 93.6
percent.
Virtual Virginia teachers are highly qualified and hold Virginia licenses in their content area.
"Although teachers’ loads vary by course, the average student to full-time teacher ratio is 1:109."
Public school students enroll in Virtual Virginia courses via their local school counselors.
"Schools must provide an adult mentor, the required textbooks, and technology resources. The"
local schools award letter grades and graduation credit for the courses taken.
Advanced Placement courses are tuition free for students participating in the Early College
Scholars (ECS) program; non-ECS students pay a reduced tuition of $375 times the Local
Composite Index (LCI). Standard courses are tuition free for public school students. Tuition is
"charged for nonpublic and out-of-state students; in addition, a $75 drop fee is assessed if students"
withdraw after the 21 st day of class.
"Virtual Virginia has served over 28,000 students since its inception in 2002. Currently there are"
30
"19,433 half-credit enrollments, including more than 5,000 students enrolled in the Economics"
and Personal Finance course. Current enrollment numbers reflect almost a 40 percent increase in
"half-credit enrollments over the 13,946 half-credit enrollments last year. One hundred and thirty-"
one students remain on waiting lists for spring block courses. It is anticipated that these students
will be served.
X. Closing Statement by the Virginia Board of Education
"Working with its many partners, the Board of Education will continue developing policies and"
providing leadership that improve student achievement and prepare students to succeed in
postsecondary education and the workplace. Virginia’s excellent statewide system of public
education derives strength from its diversity and ensures equality of opportunity for each student
"in a safe and healthy learning environment that prepares all students to be capable, responsible,"
and self-reliant citizens in the global society.
Achieving the mission of the Board will not be easy. As schools implement more rigorous
"standards and tests, we have witnessed declines in passing rates and school accreditation. Even"
more attention and resources will need to be focused on closing the achievement gaps that persist
"among student subgroups and on chronically underperforming schools. We must not, however,"
become alarmed or discouraged or yield to the temptation to preserve the status quo. Raising
"expectations is the right thing to do, and our teachers and schools will rise to the challenge."
Virginia students will be better prepared as a result.
Current conditions remind us more than ever that the key to economic recovery is a strong
education system. The Board of Education will continue to think creatively and work
"collaboratively to assure that its goals and strategies are relevant, practical, and effective."

Appendix A
Historical Overview of the Standards of Learning Program
The Standards of Learning (SOL) have provided a foundation for increased student achievement
for nearly two decades. The standards are at the core of a statewide system of support and
accountability that has helped make Virginia’s public schools among the nation’s best.
Origins of reform
"While the term “Standards of Learning” dates to the early 1980s, what Virginians today regard as"
the SOL program began in the mid 1990s in the wake of several ineffective attempts at reform
and dramatic declines in the achievement of Virginia students on national assessments.
"In 1994, the reading scores of Virginia fourth graders on the National Assessment of Educational"
"Progress (NAEP) plummeted. This jolt, coupled with a decade of declining SAT scores, lead to a"
bipartisan consensus around the need for more rigorous academic and instructional standards in
the Commonwealth’s public schools.
The structure of the reform took shape through Governor George Allen’s Commission on
Champion Schools and the work of the Virginia Board of Education and then-Superintendent of
Public Instruction William C. Bosher Jr.
"In June 1995, the Board of Education revised the Standards of Learning in English, mathematics,"
history and science to increase specificity and content rigor. Bosher described the revised SOLs
"as “the most rigorous set of standards in math, science, English and social studies Virginia has"
ever known.”
"Seven months later, Allen’s commission made its recommendations on the creation of an"
accountability program based on the new standards. The recommendations included statewide
"testing in all four content areas, an achievement-based school accreditation system and the"
publication of annual school report cards.
"In September 1997, the Board of Education revised its Regulations Establishing Standards for"
Accrediting Public Schools in Virginia to carry out the Commission on Champion Schools’
recommendations and create what we now call the SOL program.
SOL testing begins
"SOL testing began in 1998 as students in grades 3, 5, 8 and in high school took assessments in"
"reading, writing, mathematics, history and science. Results from the 1998 tests were used to"
establish proficiency standards for students.
"The following year, schools were assigned accreditation ratings based on student achievement on"
"the SOL tests. In 1999, only 116, or 6.5 percent, of the Commonwealth’s 1,791 schools met the"
"accreditation standard, although achievement increased on all tests. Under the new accreditation"
"standards, all schools were expected to have pass rates of at least 70 percent in all four content"
areas by 2006-2007.
"Despite the initially low pass rates on the new state tests, results from the 1998 national reading"
tests provided an early indication that the SOL program was having a positive impact on student
32
achievement. The percentage of students meeting NAEP’s rigorous standard for proficiency
jumped four points. Then-Board of Education President Kirk Schroder described the 1998 NAEP
results as tangible evidence that Virginia schools were moving in the right direction.
Creating a statewide system of support
"SOL-related initiatives were launched by Allen and his successor, Governor James Gilmore, to"
support schools in their efforts to improve reading skills and identify and assist students at risk of
"not meeting new, more rigorous graduation requirements. These efforts marked the beginning of"
the development of a statewide system of support linked to the standards.
The General Assembly approved the Virginia Early Reading Initiative in 1997 to provide early
"intervention for kindergartners and first graders (in 2000, this Allen-era initiative was expanded"
to include students through grade 3). The initiative included the development of a powerful
diagnostic assessment to enable teachers and reading specialists to identify and correct reading
problems sooner rather than later.
New algebra-related courses and professional development opportunities were developed for
"middle and high school mathematics teachers, and in 2000, the General Assembly approved"
Gilmore’s Algebra Readiness Initiative to support diagnostic and intervention services for
students in grades 6-9 at risk of not passing the Algebra I SOL test.
"During their 2000 session, state lawmakers also approved Gilmore’s SOL Technology Initiative,"
setting Virginia on a course to become a national leader in online assessment. The initiative
"authorized annual grants to school divisions, funded through the issuance of notes by the"
"Virginia Public School Authority, to create the infrastructure and purchase the hardware required"
"for online testing, as well as to increase students’ access to technology. By fall 2001, students in"
15 school divisions were taking at least some SOL tests online.
The 2000 General Assembly also responded to requests from school divisions by directing the
Virginia Department of Education (VDOE) to develop three new course-specific history/social
science tests to administer in grades 5-8 as an alternative to the cumulative grade-8 history/social
science assessment. The cumulative test was ultimately phased out in 2008.
"Also in 2000, VDOE academic review teams began visiting low-performing schools and"
assisting in the development and implementation of improvement plans. The Board of Education
required schools reviewed because of low student achievement in reading and mathematics to
implement instructional programs of proven effectiveness.
"During this same year, the Board of Education revised it accountability regulations to provide"
additional options and flexibility for students in meeting assessment-related diploma
requirements that were scheduled to become effective with the class of 2004. The changes
"included allowing students to substitute Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate and"
other rigorous assessments for end-of-course SOL tests in the same subjects.
Support for students and schools
"After his election in 2001, Governor Mark R. Warner signaled his support for the Standards of"
Learning reform program by re-appointing Jo-Lynne DeMary as superintendent of public
33
instruction. Warner subsequently endorsed the SOLs explicitly during remarks to the Board of
Education and the Virginia Association of School Superintendents.
"At Warner’s direction, an Office of School Improvement was created within VDOE to work"
closely with low-performing schools to implement best practices.
Warner built on the Board’s academic review process with his Partnership for Achieving
Successful Schools (PASS) initiative. PASS paired Title I schools that had become subject to
sanctions under the federal No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 with similar schools that were
meeting state and federal standards. The initiative also identified community and private sector
partners to provide resources and opportunities for students and teachers.
Continued improvement and innovation
Year-to-year increases in achievement on the SOL tests resulted in ever-higher percentages of
"schools earning full accreditation. By the fall of 2002, 64 percent of the Commonwealth’s"
schools had met or exceeded the standards.
“In schools where principals and teachers are implementing best practices and working
"collaboratively with the department’s academic review teams, instruction is improving and"
"student achievement is rising,” DeMary said."
Virginia’s online assessment system continued to grow as more high schools began
"administering SOL end-of-course tests online. During the spring 2003 test administration,"
"students in 94 school divisions took approximately 76,000 online assessments. Schools reported"
that students were comfortable with the online format and that the web-based tests allowed
initially unsuccessful students the benefit of speedier retakes.
Results from the 2002 national reading tests showed that the skills of Virginia students continued
to improve and that the Commonwealth’s students were among the nation’s strongest readers.
The percentage of Virginia fourth graders at or above grade level in reading rose seven points to
37 percent. An equal percentage of Virginia eighth graders met or exceeded the NAEP
"proficiency standard in reading, a four-point improvement from 1998."
"Mark C. Christie, who led the Board of Education during the final year of the Gilmore"
"administration and the first year of the Warner administration, responded to criticism that the"
gains on the state and national tests did not represent real increases in learning. Christie’s May
2004 article in Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service’s Virginia News Letter also compared
the SOL program with earlier attempts at reform.
"Critics claim that these dramatic gains merely reflect ""teaching to the test."" This"
cliché is the most intellectually shallow of all the arguments made against the
SOL program. The SOL tests measure student learning of the SOL academic
"content, and our academic content standards in English, math, science and"
history are among the best in the nation. The SOL reading tests measure a
"student's ability to read, the SOL writing tests measure the ability to write, the"
SOL math tests measure the student's ability to do math. Do we want teachers to
teach these skills? Of course we do.
34
The performance of Virginia students on the SAT — the dominant college admissions test in the
Commonwealth — in 2002 and 2003 provided additional evidence that the SOL program was
making an impact on achievement. Virginia high school seniors posted a five-point increase in
mathematics on the 2002 SAT and four-point improvement in reading the following year.
The 2003 SAT scores represented an 11-point improvement in mathematics since the beginning
"of SOL testing in 1998 and a seven-point improvement in reading. Nearly 8,400 more Virginia"
high school seniors took the SAT in 2003 compared with participation five years earlier.
"“By taking the SAT in ever-greater numbers, Virginia students are showing that they are"
"increasingly confident of their academic abilities,” said Thomas M. Jackson Jr., who succeeded"
Christie as state board president.
New diploma standards take effect
"In 2003, Warner launched Project Graduation to help struggling rising seniors pass the SOL tests"
"required to earn a standard or advanced diploma. At the same time, Warner said there would be"
no retreat from the new diploma requirements due to take effect in 2004.
"Project Graduation, which remains part of the SOL program’s statewide system of support,"
"included regional summer academies — where students received focused instruction in reading,"
"writing, and Algebra I — and opportunities to retake corresponding SOL tests."
Thanks to Project Graduation and similar local initiatives — and the efforts of Virginia teachers
in preparing students for the higher diploma standards — predictions that tens of thousands of
seniors would be denied diplomas in 2004 did not materialize.
"Statewide, 2004 graduates equaled 73.5 percent of ninth-grade enrollment four years earlier,"
compared with an average estimated four-year graduation rate over the previous five years of
74.7 percent.
"Warner had fulfilled his promise not to “blink” — as other states had — when new, more"
rigorous diploma standards were about to take effect.
A 10-year trend of higher achievement
"By 2005, 92 percent of Virginia schools had earned full accreditation as student achievement on"
"the SOLs increased. ""This year's accreditation ratings cap a long, bipartisan process in which we"
"stood firm in our efforts to raise standards and insist on accountability,"" Warner said."
"“The commitment of successive administrations, the General Assembly, and the Board of"
Education to the Standards of Learning has allowed Virginia to increase student achievement and
"provide students and schools with a foundation for even greater success,” DeMary said."
The performance of Virginia students on national reading and mathematics tests in 2005
continued what DeMary described as a 10-year trend of higher achievement in reading and
mathematics reflecting the improving quality of instruction in the Commonwealth’s public
schools. Virginia fourth- and eighth-grade students again performed at higher levels than their
national and regional counterparts.
35
The percentage of Virginia fourth graders meeting or exceeding the NAEP proficiency standard
"in mathematics increased in 2005 to 39 percent (compared with only 19 percent in 1996), and the"
percentage of eighth graders meeting the standard in mathematics increased to 33 percent
(compared with 21 percent in 1996).
Virginia fourth-graders led the nation on the 2005 NAEP in science. Forty percent met or
"exceeded the rigorous NAEP standard for science proficiency, compared with 32 percent five"
"years earlier. Nationwide, only 27 percent of fourth-graders achieved at the proficient level or"
"above. Thirty-five percent of Virginia students in grade 8 met or exceeded the NAEP standard,"
"compared with 29 percent five years earlier. Nationwide, 27 percent of eighth-graders performed"
at the proficient level or above.
The performance of Virginia high school seniors on the SAT also improved significantly in
"2005. The average mathematics score of Virginia public school seniors increased by six points,"
which was the largest increase in mathematics achievement in the nation.
Virginia also was poised to join a select group of states in which 20 percent or more of high
school seniors qualified for college credit by earning a grade of 3 or more on an Advanced
"Placement (AP) examination. During 2005, 19.3 percent of the Commonwealth’s public high"
"school seniors earned a grade of 3 or better on at least one AP test, compared with 15.9 percent"
in 2000. Only four states had a higher percentage of seniors earning grades of 3 or better.
New tests challenge middle schools
"In 2006, new reading and mathematics SOL tests were introduced in grades 4, 6 and 7 to comply"
with the NCLB requirement for annual testing in these subjects in grades 3-8. The new grade-
level assessments represented a significant increase in expectations as students were required to
"demonstrate a deeper mastery of content, especially in math. Mathematics pass rates plunged in"
middle schools across the state. While nine out of 10 schools still earned full accreditation for
"2006-2007, 86 of the state’s 307 middle schools were accredited with warning."
The 2006-2007 school year also was the first to see schools denied accreditation because of
persistently low-achievement on the state tests. Four of the six schools denied accreditation were
in Petersburg and two were in Sussex County. VDOE’s Office of School Improvement began
intensive interventions in these and other low-performing school divisions.
The challenge presented by the more rigorous middle school assessments was met as VDOE and
"school divisions collaborated to develop new resources, especially for mathematics teachers. The"
department invited top middle school mathematics teachers from around the Commonwealth to
participate in the creation of a series of videos illustrating how various concepts and operations
could be effectively presented to diverse learners.
"These resources, and others developed as part of this effort, were distributed to school divisions"
and posted on the VDOE website. The response to the middle school mathematics challenge
created a template for future state-division collaborations.
Expanding accountability and recognizing excellence
"At the start of his administration in 2006, Governor Timothy M. Kaine called on the Board of"
Education to include graduation as an accountability factor in the accreditation of high schools.
36
“Most of Virginia’s high school students are meeting or exceeding the Commonwealth’s diploma
standards but we must redouble our efforts to address the issues that historically have caused
"students to dropout or complete high school without earning a diploma,” said Mark E. Emblidge,"
a former Richmond school board chairman who became president of the state board shortly after
Kaine took office.
The board revised the Commonwealth’s accreditation standards to require high schools to meet
an annual benchmark for graduation. This addition to the board’s accountability standards
became effective with accreditation ratings for the 2011-2012 school year and was made possible
by the development in 2008 of a longitudinal student data system that allowed VDOE to
"calculate cohort graduation and dropout rates for schools, divisions and the state."
School divisions began preparing for the new accountability measure by improving student-data
systems and developing new programs to identify and assist students at risk of dropping out.
"In 2008, VDOE reported a statewide four-year graduation rate of 81.3 percent for the class of"
"2008. The following March, VDOE reported a statewide dropout rate of 8.7 percent. By 2013,"
the graduation rate had risen to 89.1 percent and the dropout rate had fallen to 5.9 percent.
Kaine also urged the Board of Education to create a mechanism within the SOL program to
recognize and reward schools and school divisions that far exceed state and federal
accountability standards. The Board responded in 2007 by approving the Virginia Index of
Performance (VIP) incentive program.
Virginia’s progress under the SOL program was recognized by Education Week in its January
2007 Quality Counts report. The report described Virginia students as the most likely to succeed
in the nation and said that the typical student in the Commonwealth “enjoys higher achievement
and is more likely to finish high school and continue on to college than in other states.” Virginia
continues to rank among the top states — most recently fourth — in the annual Quality Counts
report.
The College Board’s 2007 Advanced Placement Report to the Nation provided what Kaine
described as another milestone on Virginia’s journey from “competence to excellence” under the
SOL program as Virginia joined the handful of states in which 20 percent or more of high school
seniors earned a grade of 3 or more on an AP examination. Only three states had higher
percentages of seniors with scores qualifying for college credit.
Virginia fourth and eighth graders achieved significant overall gains in mathematics on the 2007
"NAEP, compared with performance on the national tests two years earlier. And for the first time"
"since the beginning of the national assessment program in the early 1990s, a majority – 60"
percent – of black fourth graders in the Commonwealth demonstrated reading proficiency at or
above the basic level.
"Billy K. Cannaday Jr., who succeeded DeMary as state superintendent, said the improvements"
"made 2007 a “watershed year” for the 12-year-old SOL program. ""Because of the efforts of"
thousands of teachers and other educators – and the Commonwealth's commitment to the
37
Standards of Learning – students who traditionally have lagged behind are now achieving at
"higher levels,"" Cannaday said."
Virginia was the only state to receive a perfect score for academic standards from the American
Federation of Teachers (AFT) in the union’s Sizing Up Standards 2008 report. The AFT
"evaluated Virginia’s SOLs and the academic standards of other states for clarity, specificity and"
content. The report by the nation’s second-largest teachers’ union cited Virginia as the only state
"in the nation to meet the AFTs’ criteria for strong standards in English, mathematics, science and"
history at all grade levels and in all subject areas.
College- and career-ready standards
As it prepared to carry out legislatively mandated reviews of the Standards of Learning in
"mathematics and English, the Board of Education directed VDOE to study factors contributing to"
"success in postsecondary education. As part of that effort, the department asked the College"
"Board, ACT and the bipartisan education reform organization Achieve to compare their"
respective standards for postsecondary readiness with the English and mathematics SOLs.
The board’s determination to increase the rigor of the SOL program — by shifting its focus from
grade-level competency to college and career readiness — was reinforced by the relatively flat
performance of Virginia students on the 2009 NAEP. “Our challenge is to build on the progress
Virginia students have already made under the Standards of Learning program — especially in
"middle school and among minority students,” then-Board President Eleanor B. Saslaw said."
The 2009 revision of Virginia’s mathematics standards and the 2010 revision of the English and
"science SOLs reflected the input of the College Board, ACT and Achieve, as well as"
recommendations from college faculty and the business community.
"“If Virginia’s students master the state standards, they will likely be well prepared for both"
"workplace and college success,” Achieve reported."
"After taking office in 2010, Governor Robert F. McDonnell signaled his support for increasing"
the rigor of the SOL program as Virginia came under pressure from the US Department of
Education to replace the SOLs with the newly developed Common Core State Standards.
"""We can't go back,” McDonnell told the Washington Post in May 2010. “We've been working on"
this for 15 years.”
"The following month, the Board of Education reaffirmed its commitment to the SOL program"
and opposition to adoption of the Common Core as a prerequisite for participation in federal
competitive grant programs.
“The Standards of Learning are clear and rigorous and have won the acceptance and trust of
"Virginia educators,” the board said in a unanimously approved resolution. “Whatever"
adjustments might be warranted to ensure alignment of the SOL with the Common Core State
Standards can be made within the process through which the Board of Education exercises its
constitutional authority to establish standards for the Commonwealth’s public schools.”
"In January 2011, Superintendent of Public Instruction Patricia I. Wright, who succeeded"
"Cannaday during the Kaine administration and was reappointed by McDonnell, warned state"
38
lawmakers that the transition to more rigorous standards would lead to short-term declines in
pass rates on state tests.
“Our schools will begin a new trend line as these more rigorous standards and benchmarks
"become effective over the next few years,” Wright said. “But we must not become alarmed or"
discouraged. And we must not give in to the temptation to preserve the status quo when we know
in our hearts that we must raise standards for our young people to remain competitive in the 21st
century.”
"Also in January, the National Center for Education statistics released results from revamped"
national science assessments administered in 2009. Virginia fourth graders again led the nation
"in science, with 46 percent meeting or exceeding the NAEP proficiency standard. Thirty-six"
"percent of Virginia eighth graders performed at or above the proficiency level, with students in"
only six states ranking higher.
"By spring 2011, 2.2 million SOL tests were being taken online. Pleased with the growth and"
"success of the online assessment program, the General Assembly mandated that all SOL tests be"
"administered online by spring 2013, except in cases where a student’s disability necessitated a"
paper-and-pencil test.
"In a July 2011 commentary published by the Richmond Times-Dispatch, Wright addressed"
questions about the growth of testing in the Commonwealth’s schools:
Is there too much testing in Virginia’s public schools? Is “test preparation”
crowding out real teaching and learning in some schools? You may be surprised
"that my answer, as one of the architects of the SOL program, is “yes” to both"
questions.
"But in considering the amount of testing, it is important to distinguish between the"
actual SOL tests required by the Commonwealth and the myriad assessments that
local administrators have put in place to identify students at risk of not passing
the SOLs and potentially jeopardizing a school’s accountability rating.
Wright also noted the concerns of Board of Education members that local decisions sometimes
"prevented teachers from weaving SOL content into engaging curriculum, as originally intended"
by the Board. She pointed out that the overemphasis on “test prep” in some divisions was also
counter to research showing that the best way to prepare students is to provide instruction that
exceeds the depth and rigor of the standards.
"Accreditation ratings announced in the fall of 2011 marked an all-time high, despite the"
introduction of new history and social science SOL tests during 2010-2011. Ninety-six percent of
schools were fully accredited and only eight middle schools remained on academic warning.
Additional evidence of the continuing impact of the SOL reform was provided by results from
"the 2011 NAEP. In mathematics, the percentage of grade-8 students who met or exceeded the"
NAEP standard for proficiency increased by four points to 40 percent and the percentage of
fourth-grade students at or above proficiency rose three points to 46 percent.
39
Wright said the gains on the national mathematics tests confirmed the improvements in teaching
"and learning that followed the introduction of grade-level SOL testing in 2006, and mirrored"
increases in achievement on the middle school mathematics and Algebra I SOL tests.
Beyond multiple choice
"Students began taking SOL tests based on the 2009 mathematics standards in 2011-2012, and"
"new tests in reading, writing and science were introduced in 2012-2013. The new online"
assessments included innovative technology-enhanced items that required students to apply their
content knowledge and employ problem-solving and critical-thinking skills. The items mirrored
students’ classroom experiences and were widely praised by mathematics teachers and division-
level instructional leaders.
"As predicted, the new SOLs produced lower pass rates. But during 2012-2013, the second year"
"for the new mathematics assessments, students made gains on every grade-level and end-of-"
course mathematics test.
"“As schools adapt to the new SOLs and as our talented, hardworking teachers continue to engage"
"students, I am confident that we will see improvement in English and science scores just as we"
"did in math scores,” Board of Education President David M. Foster said. “In turn, we will"
"improve the odds that our graduates are equipped to succeed in a competitive, fast-changing"
world. We owe it to our students and to ourselves to set high expectations — and then to do all
that we can to help each student meet those expectations.”
In response to concerns from school divisions about the amount of time it took some students to
"complete the new mathematics SOL tests, VDOE surveyed teachers and other educators from 16"
"relatively high-scoring divisions. High expectations for students, thorough knowledge of the"
"2009 Mathematics SOL Curriculum Framework, and an emphasis on multistep problem solving"
and vocabulary throughout the year were cited as contributing to the success of students who
completed the new tests in three or fewer hours.
An online survey conducted at the close of the 2011-2012 school year found overwhelming
support among teachers for increasing the flow of SOL-related information and resources from
"VDOE directly to classroom teachers. As a result, the department in January 2013 launched"
"TeacherDirect, a weekly e-mail bulletin informing teachers of the latest SOL resources and"
professional development opportunities. This marked a significant break from the long-standing
practice of channeling information through school division central offices.
"By the fall of 2013, the impact of the Commonwealth’s college- and career-ready standards and"
assessments was clear in the accreditation ratings by VDOE.
"Seventy-seven percent, or 1,413, of Virginia’s 1,828 public schools were rated as fully"
"accredited for 2013-2014, compared with 93 percent for 2012-2013. The number of schools"
"accredited with warning nearly quadrupled to 395, and six schools have been denied state"
accreditation because of chronically low achievement.
"“Over the last five years, the accreditation bar has been raised through the introduction of more"
rigorous curriculum standards and challenging new assessments that test students’ problem-
"solving and critical-thinking skills as well as their content knowledge,” Wright said. “In addition,"
40
"the benchmark pass rates required for full accreditation have increased, and high schools must"
meet goals for improving graduation rates.”
“The focus of the SOL program has shifted to the ambitious but vital goal of college and career
"readiness for all students,” Foster added. “Temporary declines in SOL scores and accreditation"
"ratings are signs that the Commonwealth is expecting more, not that students are learning less.”"
The 2013-2014 school year opened on an encouraging note as results from both the ACT and
"SAT college-admissions tests showed across-board-gains for Virginia students, despite"
nationwide declines in student achievement on both assessments.
The percentage of Virginia public school students meeting ACT’s college-readiness benchmarks
"in English, reading, mathematics and science was 10 or more points higher than the percentages"
nationwide. Black students narrowed the achievement gap in all three SAT subject areas by
achieving larger gains than Virginia public school students overall.
Foster said the SAT and ACT results demonstrated that Virginia students were continuing to
make progress under the SOL program and the college- and career-ready expectations introduced
by the Board since 2009.
International Comparisons
"In October 2013, a long-awaited National Center for Education Statistics study connecting 2011"
NAEP mathematics and science scores of American students with results from the 2011 Trends
in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) ranked Virginia eighth graders above
international averages in both subjects.
The study ranked the mathematics achievement of Virginia eighth graders higher than that of
"peers in 39 countries and systems, including Finland. Finland’s public schools are frequently"
"held up as a model for states to emulate. Only students in South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan"
"(Chinese Taipei), Hong Kong, Japan, Russia and Quebec ranked higher. Mathematics"
achievement in one country — Israel — was found to be similar to achievement in Virginia.
The study found that Virginia eighth graders achieved at a statistically higher level in science
"than students in 37 countries and systems, including Hong Kong and Russia. Students in only"
"four countries — Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan — were ranked higher. The study"
rated the science achievement of students in six countries and systems — including Finland — as
equivalent to that of Virginia students.
2013 NAEP
The 2013 NAEP reading and mathematics tests showed that the reading skills of Virginia fourth-
grade students improved significantly between 2009 and 2013. Forty-three percent of the
"commonwealth’s grade-4 students met or exceeded the NAEP proficiency, compared with 38"
percent four years earlier.
"In mathematics, 47 percent of the state’s fourth graders achieved scores at or above the proficient"
"level, compared with 46 percent in 2011, 43 percent in 2009 and 42 percent in 2007. The"
improvement since 2007 was seen as statistically significant.
41
The reading achievement of Virginia eighth graders on the 2013 NAEP was flat. Thirty-six
"percent achieved at or above the proficient level in reading, the same percentage as in 2011."
“The 2010 revisions to the English SOL place increased emphasis on strengthening adolescent
literacy and equipping students with the reading skills they will need during their first year of
"college or in the work force,” Superintendent of Public Instruction Wright said. “As schools"
"implement these more challenging standards and state tests, I expect to see an improvement in"
the performance of Virginia middle and high school students on national reading assessments.”
Thirty-eight percent of Virginia eighth graders achieved proficient or advanced mathematics
"scores on the 2013 NAEP, compared with 40 percent in 2011. The two-point decline was not"
"statistically noteworthy. Eighth graders in only five states — Massachusetts, New Hampshire,"
"New Jersey, Minnesota and Vermont — achieved higher average math scores. The National"
Center for Education Statistics described the increase in grade-8 mathematics achievement in
Virginia since 2005 — when 33 percent earned proficient or advanced scores — as significant.
In Conclusion
"As his term as president of the Board of Education neared its end, Foster reflected on how far"
Virginia’s public schools have come under the SOL program and on the challenges that remain:
"“In education as elsewhere, those who would make sound policy look at long-"
term trends and multiple measures. All of the trends and measures point in the
"same direction: SAT scores are up, ACT scores are up, NAEP scores are up,"
"Advanced Placement scores are up, graduation rates are up, and minority"
"achievement is up. Remarkably, Virginians are even competing favorably with"
Finland and three dozen other countries in math and science assessments.
"“None of this has been easy, of course, nor will pursuing the road ahead to"
universal proficiency and the elimination of achievement gaps be easy. We still
have a lot of hard work to do. But as President Kennedy famously said of the
"space race, ‘We do not do these things because they are easy; we do them"
"because they are hard.’ Those who value the future of our young people, our"
"Commonwealth, and our nation will not do the easy thing and abandon the SOL-"
based reforms that have taken us this far. They will stay the course until we have
accomplished even harder things.”

"B. The Board of Education shall establish educational objectives known as the Standards of Learning, which shall"
"form the core of Virginia's educational program, and other educational objectives, which together are designed to"
ensure the development of the skills that are necessary for success in school and for preparation for life in the years
"beyond. At a minimum, the Board shall establish Standards of Learning for English, mathematics, science, and"
history and social science. The Standards of Learning shall not be construed to be regulations as defined in § 2.2-
4001.
The Board shall seek to ensure that the Standards of Learning are consistent with a high-quality foundation
"educational program. The Standards of Learning shall include, but not be limited to, the basic skills of"
"communication (listening, speaking, reading, and writing); computation and critical reasoning, including problem"
solving and decision making; proficiency in the use of computers and related technology; and the skills to manage
personal finances and to make sound financial decisions.
The English Standards of Learning for reading in kindergarten through grade three shall be based on components of
"effective reading instruction, to include, at a minimum, phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary"
"development, and text comprehension."
The Standards of Learning in all subject areas shall be subject to regular review and revision to maintain rigor and to
reflect a balance between content knowledge and the application of knowledge in preparation for eventual
"employment and lifelong learning. The Board of Education shall establish a regular schedule, in a manner it deems"
"appropriate, for the review, and revision as may be necessary, of the Standards of Learning in all subject areas. Such"
review of each subject area shall occur at least once every seven years. Nothing in this section shall be construed to
prohibit the Board from conducting such review and revision on a more frequent basis.
"To provide appropriate opportunity for input from the general public, teachers, and local school boards, the Board of"
Education shall conduct public hearings prior to establishing revised Standards of Learning. Thirty days prior to
"conducting such hearings, the Board shall give notice of the date, time, and place of the hearings to all local school"
boards and any other persons requesting to be notified of the hearings and publish notice of its intention to revise the
Standards of Learning in the Virginia Register of Regulations. Interested parties shall be given reasonable
opportunity to be heard and present information prior to final adoption of any revisions of the Standards of Learning.
"In addition, the Department of Education shall make available and maintain a website, either separately or through"
"an existing website utilized by the Department of Education, enabling public elementary, middle, and high school"
"educators to submit recommendations for improvements relating to the Standards of Learning, when under review"
46
"by the Board according to its established schedule, and related assessments required by the Standards of Quality"
pursuant to this chapter. Such website shall facilitate the submission of recommendations by educators.
School boards shall implement the Standards of Learning or objectives specifically designed for their school
divisions that are equivalent to or exceed the Board's requirements. Students shall be expected to achieve the
educational objectives established by the school division at appropriate age or grade levels. The curriculum adopted
by the local school division shall be aligned to the Standards of Learning.
The Board of Education shall include in the Standards of Learning for history and social science the study of
"contributions to society of diverse people. For the purposes of this subsection, ""diverse"" includes consideration of"
"disability, ethnicity, race, and gender."
"The Board of Education shall include in the Standards of Learning for health instruction in emergency first aid,"
"cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and the use of an automated external defibrillator, including hands-on practice of the"
skills necessary to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Such instruction shall be based on the current national
evidence-based emergency cardiovascular care guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and the use of an
"automated external defibrillator, such as a program developed by the American Heart Association or the American"
Red Cross. No teacher who is in compliance with subdivision D 4 of § 22.1-298.1 shall be required to be certified as
a trainer of cardiopulmonary resuscitation to provide instruction for non-certification.
"With such funds as are made available for this purpose, the Board shall regularly review and revise the competencies"
"for career and technical education programs to require the full integration of English, mathematics, science, and"
history and social science Standards of Learning. Career and technical education programs shall be aligned with
"industry and professional standard certifications, where they exist."
C. Local school boards shall develop and implement a program of instruction for grades K through 12 that is aligned
to the Standards of Learning and meets or exceeds the requirements of the Board of Education. The program of
"instruction shall emphasize reading, writing, speaking, mathematical concepts and computations, proficiency in the"
"use of computers and related technology, and scientific concepts and processes; essential skills and concepts of"
"citizenship, including knowledge of Virginia history and world and United States history, economics, government,"
"foreign languages, international cultures, health and physical education, environmental issues, and geography"
"necessary for responsible participation in American society and in the international community; fine arts, which may"
"include, but need not be limited to, music and art, and practical arts; knowledge and skills needed to qualify for"
"further education, gainful employment, or training in a career or technical field; and development of the ability to"
47
apply such skills and knowledge in preparation for eventual employment and lifelong learning and to achieve
economic self-sufficiency.
"Local school boards shall also develop and implement programs of prevention, intervention, or remediation for"
"students who are educationally at risk including, but not limited to, those who fail to achieve a passing score on any"

Any student who fails to achieve a passing score on all of the Standards of Learning assessments for the relevant
grade level in grades three through eight or who fails an end-of-course test required for the award of a verified unit
of credit shall be required to attend a remediation program or to participate in another form of remediation. Division
"superintendents shall require such students to take special programs of prevention, intervention, or remediation,"
"which may include attendance in public summer school programs, in accordance with clause (ii) of subsection A of"
§ 22.1-254 and § 22.1-254.01.
"Remediation programs shall include, when applicable, a procedure for early identification of students who are at risk"
of failing the Standards of Learning assessments in grades three through eight or who fail an end-of-course test
required for the award of a verified unit of credit. Such programs may also include summer school for all elementary
"and middle school grades and for all high school academic courses, as defined by regulations promulgated by the"
"Board of Education, or other forms of remediation. Summer school remediation programs or other forms of"
remediation shall be chosen by the division superintendent to be appropriate to the academic needs of the student.
Students who are required to attend such summer school programs or to participate in another form of remediation
shall not be charged tuition by the school division.
"The requirement for remediation may, however, be satisfied by the student's attendance in a program of prevention,"
"intervention or remediation that has been selected by his parent, in consultation with the division superintendent or"
"his designee, and is either (i) conducted by an accredited private school or (ii) a special program that has been"
determined to be comparable to the required public school remediation program by the division superintendent. The
costs of such private school remediation program or other special remediation program shall be borne by the
student's parent.
48
"The Board of Education shall establish standards for full funding of summer remedial programs that shall include,"
"but not be limited to, the minimum number of instructional hours or the equivalent thereof required for full funding"
and an assessment system designed to evaluate program effectiveness. Based on the number of students attending
"and the Commonwealth's share of the per pupil instructional costs, state funds shall be provided for the full cost of"
"summer and other remediation programs as set forth in the appropriation act, provided such programs comply with"
"such standards as shall be established by the Board, pursuant to § 22.1-199.2."
D. Local school boards shall also implement the following:
1. Programs in grades K through three that emphasize developmentally appropriate learning to enhance success.

"§ 22.1-253.13:2. Standard 2. Instructional, administrative, and support personnel."
"A. The Board shall establish requirements for the licensing of teachers, principals, superintendents, and other"
professional personnel.
B. School boards shall employ licensed instructional personnel qualified in the relevant subject areas.
C. Each school board shall assign licensed instructional personnel in a manner that produces divisionwide ratios of
"students in average daily membership to full-time equivalent teaching positions, excluding special education"
"teachers, principals, assistant principals, counselors, and librarians, that are not greater than the following ratios: (i)"
52
24 to one in kindergarten with no class being larger than 29 students; if the average daily membership in any
"kindergarten class exceeds 24 pupils, a full-time teacher's aide shall be assigned to the class; (ii) 24 to one in grades"
"one, two, and three with no class being larger than 30 students; (iii) 25 to one in grades four through six with no"
class being larger than 35 students; and (iv) 24 to one in English classes in grades six through 12.
"Within its regulations governing special education programs, the Board shall seek to set pupil/teacher ratios for"
pupils with intellectual disability that do not exceed the pupil/teacher ratios for self-contained classes for pupils with
specific learning disabilities.
"Further, school boards shall assign instructional personnel in a manner that produces schoolwide ratios of students in"
average daily memberships to full-time equivalent teaching positions of 21 to one in middle schools and high
schools. School divisions shall provide all middle and high school teachers with one planning period per day or the
"equivalent, unencumbered of any teaching or supervisory duties."
"D. Each local school board shall employ with state and local basic, special education, gifted, and career and"
"technical education funds a minimum number of licensed, full-time equivalent instructional personnel for each 1,000"
students in average daily membership (ADM) as set forth in the appropriation act. Calculations of kindergarten
positions shall be based on full-day kindergarten programs. Beginning with the March 31 report of average daily
"membership, those school divisions offering half-day kindergarten with pupil/teacher ratios that exceed 30 to one"
shall adjust their average daily membership for kindergarten to reflect 85 percent of the total kindergarten average
"daily memberships, as provided in the appropriation act."
"E. In addition to the positions supported by basic aid and in support of regular school year programs of prevention,"
"intervention, and remediation, state funding, pursuant to the appropriation act, shall be provided to fund certain full-"
"time equivalent instructional positions for each 1,000 students in grades K through 12 who are identified as needing"
"prevention, intervention, and remediation services. State funding for prevention, intervention, and remediation"
programs provided pursuant to this subsection and the appropriation act may be used to support programs for
educationally at-risk students as identified by the local school boards.
"To provide algebra readiness intervention services required by § 22.1-253.13:1, school divisions may employ"
mathematics teacher specialists to provide the required algebra readiness intervention services. School divisions
using the Standards of Learning Algebra Readiness Initiative funding in this manner shall only employ instructional
personnel licensed by the Board of Education.
53
F. In addition to the positions supported by basic aid and those in support of regular school year programs of
"prevention, intervention, and remediation, state funding, pursuant to the appropriation act, shall be provided to"
"support 17 full-time equivalent instructional positions for each 1,000 students identified as having limited English"
proficiency.
To provide flexibility in the instruction of English language learners who have limited English proficiency and who
"are at risk of not meeting state accountability standards, school divisions may use state and local funds from the"
"Standards of Quality Prevention, Intervention, and Remediation account to employ additional English language"
learner teachers to provide instruction to identified limited English proficiency students. Using these funds in this
manner is intended to supplement the instructional services provided in this section. School divisions using the SOQ
"Prevention, Intervention, and Remediation funds in this manner shall employ only instructional personnel licensed"
by the Board of Education.
"G. In addition to the full-time equivalent positions required elsewhere in this section, each local school board shall"
"employ the following reading specialists in elementary schools, one full-time in each elementary school at the"
discretion of the local school board.
"To provide reading intervention services required by § 22.1-253.13:1, school divisions may employ reading"
specialists to provide the required reading intervention services. School divisions using the Early Reading
Intervention Initiative funds in this manner shall employ only instructional personnel licensed by the Board of
Education.
"H. Each local school board shall employ, at a minimum, the following full-time equivalent positions for any school"
"that reports fall membership, according to the type of school and student enrollment:"
"1. Principals in elementary schools, one half-time to 299 students, one full-time at 300 students; principals in middle"
"schools, one full-time, to be employed on a 12-month basis; principals in high schools, one full-time, to be"
employed on a 12-month basis;
"2. Assistant principals in elementary schools, one half-time at 600 students, one full-time at 900 students; assistant"
"principals in middle schools, one full-time for each 600 students; assistant principals in high schools, one full-time"
for each 600 students; and school divisions that employ a sufficient number of assistant principals to meet this
staffing requirement may assign assistant principals to schools within the division according to the area of greatest
"need, regardless of whether such schools are elementary, middle, or secondary;"
54
"3. Librarians in elementary schools, one part-time to 299 students, one full-time at 300 students; librarians in middle"
"schools, one-half time to 299 students, one full-time at 300 students, two full-time at 1,000 students; librarians in"
"high schools, one half-time to 299 students, one full-time at 300 students, two full-time at 1,000 students. Local"
school divisions that employ a sufficient number of librarians to meet this staffing requirement may assign librarians
"to schools within the division according to the area of greatest need, regardless of whether such schools are"
"elementary, middle, or secondary; and"
"4. Guidance counselors in elementary schools, one hour per day per 100 students, one full-time at 500 students, one"
"hour per day additional time per 100 students or major fraction thereof; guidance counselors in middle schools, one"
"period per 80 students, one full-time at 400 students, one additional period per 80 students or major fraction thereof;"
"guidance counselors in high schools, one period per 70 students, one full-time at 350 students, one additional period"
per 70 students or major fraction thereof. Local school divisions that employ a sufficient number of guidance
counselors to meet this staffing requirement may assign guidance counselors to schools within the division
"according to the area of greatest need, regardless of whether such schools are elementary, middle, or secondary."
"I. Local school boards shall employ five full-time equivalent positions per 1,000 students in grades kindergarten"
"through five to serve as elementary resource teachers in art, music, and physical education."
"J. Local school boards shall employ two full-time equivalent positions per 1,000 students in grades kindergarten"
"through 12, one to provide technology support and one to serve as an instructional technology resource teacher."
"To provide flexibility, school divisions may use the state and local funds for instructional technology resource"
"teachers to employ a data coordinator position, an instructional technology resource teacher position, or a data"
coordinator/instructional resource teacher blended position. The data coordinator position is intended to serve as a
resource to principals and classroom teachers in the area of data analysis and interpretation for instructional and
"school improvement purposes, as well as for overall data management and administration of state assessments."
School divisions using these funds in this manner shall employ only instructional personnel licensed by the Board of
Education.
K. Local school boards may employ additional positions that exceed these minimal staffing requirements. These
"additional positions may include, but are not limited to, those funded through the state's incentive and categorical"
programs as set forth in the appropriation act.
"L. A combined school, such as kindergarten through 12, shall meet at all grade levels the staffing requirements for"
"the highest grade level in that school; this requirement shall apply to all staff, except for guidance counselors, and"
55
"shall be based on the school's total enrollment; guidance counselor staff requirements shall, however, be based on"
"the enrollment at the various school organization levels, i.e., elementary, middle, or high school. The Board of"
Education may grant waivers from these staffing levels upon request from local school boards seeking to implement
experimental or innovative programs that are not consistent with these staffing levels.
"M. School boards shall, however, annually, on or before January 1, report to the public the actual pupil/teacher ratios"
in elementary school classrooms by school for the current school year. Such actual ratios shall include only the
teachers who teach the grade and class on a full-time basis and shall exclude resource personnel. School boards shall
report pupil/teacher ratios that include resource teachers in the same annual report. Any classes funded through the
voluntary kindergarten through third grade class size reduction program shall be identified as such classes. Any
classes having waivers to exceed the requirements of this subsection shall also be identified. Schools shall be
"identified; however, the data shall be compiled in a manner to ensure the confidentiality of all teacher and pupil"
identities.
N. Students enrolled in a public school on a less than full-time basis shall be counted in ADM in the relevant school
division. Students who are either (i) enrolled in a nonpublic school or (ii) receiving home instruction pursuant to §
"22.1-254.1, and who are enrolled in public school on a less than full-time basis in any mathematics, science,"
"English, history, social science, career and technical education, fine arts, foreign language, or health education or"
physical education course shall be counted in the ADM in the relevant school division on a pro rata basis as
provided in the appropriation act. Each such course enrollment by such students shall be counted as 0.25 in the
"ADM; however, no such nonpublic or home school student shall be counted as more than one-half a student for"
purposes of such pro rata calculation. Such calculation shall not include enrollments of such students in any other
public school courses.
O. Each local school board shall provide those support services that are necessary for the efficient and cost-effective
operation and maintenance of its public schools.
"For the purposes of this title, unless the context otherwise requires, ""support services positions"" shall include the"
following:
"1. Executive policy and leadership positions, including school board members, superintendents and assistant"
superintendents;

"operation and maintenance, administration, and technology; and"
"8. School-based clerical personnel in elementary schools; part-time to 299 students, one full-time at 300 students;"
clerical personnel in middle schools; one full-time and one additional full-time for each 600 students beyond 200
students and one full-time for the library at 750 students; clerical personnel in high schools; one full-time and one
additional full-time for each 600 students beyond 200 students and one full-time for the library at 750 students.
Local school divisions that employ a sufficient number of school-based clerical personnel to meet this staffing
"requirement may assign the clerical personnel to schools within the division according to the area of greatest need,"
"regardless of whether such schools are elementary, middle, or secondary."
"Pursuant to the appropriation act, support services shall be funded from basic school aid."
School divisions may use the state and local funds for support services to provide additional instructional services.
"P. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, when determining the assignment of instructional and other"
"licensed personnel in subsections C through J, a local school board shall not be required to include full-time students"
of approved virtual school programs.
"(1988, cc. 645, 682; 1991, c. 480; 1997, c. 828; 2004, cc. 939, 955; 2005, cc. 331, 450; 2010, cc. 537, 817; 2011, cc."

57
"§ 22.1-253.13:3. Standard 3. Accreditation, other standards, assessments, and releases from state regulations."
A. The Board of Education shall promulgate regulations establishing standards for accreditation pursuant to the
"Administrative Process Act (§ 2.2-4000 et seq.), which shall include, but not be limited to, student outcome"
"measures, requirements and guidelines for instructional programs and for the integration of educational technology"
"into such instructional programs, administrative and instructional staffing levels and positions, including staff"
"positions for supporting educational technology, student services, auxiliary education programs such as library and"
"media services, course and credit requirements for graduation from high school, community relations, and the"
"philosophy, goals, and objectives of public education in Virginia."
The Board of Education shall promulgate regulations establishing standards for accreditation of public virtual
schools under the authority of the local school board that enroll students full time.
The Board shall review annually the accreditation status of all schools in the Commonwealth.
Each local school board shall maintain schools that are fully accredited pursuant to the standards for accreditation as
prescribed by the Board of Education. Each local school board shall review the accreditation status of all schools in
"the local school division annually in public session. Within the time specified by the Board of Education, each"
school board shall submit corrective action plans for any schools within its school division that have been
designated as not meeting the standards as approved by the Board.
When the Board of Education has obtained evidence through the school academic review process that the failure of
schools within a division to achieve full accreditation status is related to division level failure to implement the
"Standards of Quality, the Board may require a division level academic review. After the conduct of such review and"
"within the time specified by the Board of Education, each school board shall submit for approval by the Board a"
"corrective action plan, consistent with criteria established by the Board and setting forth specific actions and a"
schedule designed to ensure that schools within its school division achieve full accreditation status. Such corrective
action plans shall be part of the relevant school division's comprehensive plan pursuant to § 22.1-253.13:6.
"With such funds as are appropriated or otherwise received for this purpose, the Board shall adopt and implement an"
"academic review process, to be conducted by the Department of Education, to assist schools that are accredited with"
"warning. The Department shall forward a report of each academic review to the relevant local school board, and"
such school board shall report the results of such academic review and the required annual progress reports in public
session. The local school board shall implement any actions identified through the academic review and utilize them
for improvement planning.
58
B. The Superintendent of Public Instruction shall develop and the Board of Education shall approve criteria for
determining and recognizing educational performance in the Commonwealth's public school divisions and schools.
"Such criteria, when approved, shall become an integral part of the accreditation process and shall include student"
outcome measurements. The Superintendent of Public Instruction shall annually identify to the Board those school
divisions and schools that exceed or do not meet the approved criteria. Such identification shall include an analysis
of the strengths and weaknesses of public education programs in the various school divisions in Virginia and
recommendations to the General Assembly for further enhancing student learning uniformly across the
"Commonwealth. In recognizing educational performance in the school divisions, the Board shall include"
"consideration of special school division accomplishments, such as numbers of dual enrollments and students in"
"Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate courses, and participation in academic year Governor's"
Schools.
The Superintendent of Public Instruction shall assist local school boards in the implementation of action plans for
increasing educational performance in those school divisions and schools that are identified as not meeting the
approved criteria. The Superintendent of Public Instruction shall monitor the implementation of and report to the
Board of Education on the effectiveness of the corrective actions taken to improve the educational performance in
such school divisions and schools.
"C. With such funds as are available for this purpose, the Board of Education shall prescribe assessment methods to"
determine the level of achievement of the Standards of Learning objectives by all students. Such assessments shall
"evaluate knowledge, application of knowledge, critical thinking, and skills related to the Standards of Learning"
being assessed. The Board shall (i) in consultation with the chairpersons of the eight regional superintendents' study
"groups, establish a timetable for administering the Standards of Learning assessments to ensure genuine end-of-"
"course and end-of-grade testing and (ii) with the assistance of independent testing experts, conduct a regular analysis"
and validation process for these assessments.
"In prescribing such Standards of Learning assessments, the Board shall provide local school boards the option of"
"administering tests for United States History to 1877, United States History: 1877 to the Present, and Civics and"
Economics. The last administration of the cumulative grade eight history test will be during the 2007-2008 academic
"school year. Beginning with the 2008-2009 academic year, all school divisions shall administer the United States"
"History to 1877, United States History: 1877 to the Present, and Civics and Economics tests. The Board shall also"
provide the option of industry certification and state licensure examinations as a student-selected verified credit.
The Board of Education shall make publicly available such assessments in a timely manner and as soon as
"practicable following the administration of such tests, so long as the release of such assessments does not"
59
"compromise test security or deplete the bank of assessment questions necessary to construct subsequent tests, or"
limit the ability to test students on demand and provide immediate results in the web-based assessment system.
The Board shall include in the student outcome measures that are required by the Standards for Accreditation end-
"of-course or end-of-grade tests for various grade levels and classes, as determined by the Board, in accordance with"
"the Standards of Learning. These Standards of Learning assessments shall include, but need not be limited to, end-"
"of-course or end-of-grade tests for English, mathematics, science, and history and social science. Local school"
divisions shall provide targeted mathematics remediation and intervention to students in grades six through eight
who show computational deficiencies as demonstrated by their individual performance on any diagnostic test or
grade-level Standards of Learning mathematics test that measures non-calculator computational skills.
"In addition, to assess the educational progress of students, the Board of Education shall (a) develop appropriate"
"assessments, which may include criterion-referenced tests and alternative assessment instruments that may be used"
by classroom teachers; (b) select appropriate industry certification and state licensure examinations; and (c)
"prescribe and provide measures, which may include nationally normed tests to be used to identify students who"
score in the bottom quartile at selected grade levels. An annual justification that includes evidence that the student
meets the participation criteria defined by the Virginia Department of Education shall be provided for each student
considered for the Virginia Grade Level Alternative. Each Individual Education Program team shall review such
justification and make the final determination as to whether or not the Virginia Grade Level Alternative is
appropriate for the student. The superintendent and the school board chairman shall certify to the Board of
"Education, as a part of certifying compliance with the Standards of Quality, that there is a justification in the"
Individual Education Program for every student who takes the Virginia Grade Level Alternative. Compliance with
this requirement shall be monitored as a part of the special education monitoring process conducted by the
Department of Education. The Board shall report to the Governor and General Assembly in its annual reports
pursuant to § 22.1-18 any school division that is not in compliance with this requirement.
"The Standards of Learning requirements, including all related assessments, shall be waived for any student awarded"
"a scholarship under the Brown v. Board of Education Scholarship Program, pursuant to § 30-231.2, who is enrolled"
in a preparation program for the General Education Development (GED) certificate or in an adult basic education
program to obtain the high school diploma.
The Board of Education may adopt special provisions related to the administration and use of any Standards of
Learning test or tests in a content area as applied to accreditation ratings for any period during which the Standards
of Learning content or assessments in that area are being revised and phased in. Prior to statewide administration of
"such tests, the Board of Education shall provide notice to local school boards regarding such special provisions."

of Quality.
The Board of Education shall have authority to seek school division compliance with the foregoing Standards of
"Quality. When the Board of Education determines that a school division has failed or refused, and continues to fail"
"or refuse, to comply with any such Standard, the Board may petition the circuit court having jurisdiction in the"
"school division to mandate or otherwise enforce compliance with such standard, including the development or"
implementation of any required corrective action plan that a local school board has failed or refused to develop or
implement in a timely manner.
"(1988, cc. 645, 682; 1990, cc. 820, 839; 2004, cc. 939, 955, 965; 2005, cc. 331, 450.)"
§ 22.1-253.13:9. Virginia Index of Performance incentive program.
A. Schools and local school divisions shall be recognized by the Board of Education in accordance with guidelines it
shall establish for the Virginia Index of Performance (VIP) incentive program. The VIP incentive program shall be
designed to recognize and reward fully accredited schools and school divisions that make significant progress
"toward achieving advanced proficiency levels in reading, mathematics, science, and history and social science, and"
on other indicators of school and student performance that are aligned with the Commonwealth's goals for public
education. Such recognition may include:
1. Public announcements recognizing individual schools and divisions;
73
2. Tangible rewards;
3. Waivers of certain board regulations;
4. Exemptions from certain reporting requirements; or
5. Other commendations deemed appropriate to recognize high achievement.
"In addition to Board recognition, local school boards shall adopt policies to recognize individual schools through"
public announcements or media releases as well as other appropriate recognition.
"In order to encourage school divisions to promote student achievement in science, technology, engineering, and"
"mathematics, the Board of Education shall take into account in its guidelines a school division's increase in"
enrollments and elective course offerings in these areas.
B. A school that maintains a passing rate on Virginia assessment program tests or additional tests approved by the
"Board of 95 percent or above in each of the four core academic areas for two consecutive years may, upon"
"application to the Department of Education, receive a waiver from annual accreditation. A school receiving such a"
"waiver shall be fully accredited for a three-year period. However, such school shall continue to annually submit"
documentation in compliance with the pre-accreditation eligibility requirements.
C. Schools may be eligible to receive the Governor's Award for Outstanding Achievement. This award will be given
to schools rated fully accredited that significantly increase the achievement of students within student subgroups in
accordance with guidelines prescribed by the Board of Education.
D. In its guidelines for calculating an award under the Virginia Index of Performance incentive program pursuant to
"this section, the Department of Education shall take into account the number of high school students who earn the"
one-year Uniform Certificate of General Studies or an associate's degree from a community college in the
Commonwealth concurrent with a high school diploma.

Appendix F
A Status Report Regarding Multidivision Online Learning
Background
"In 2010, the Virginia General Assembly passed legislation, introduced by Delegate Richard P."
"Bell on behalf of Governor Robert F. McDonnell, authorizing the establishment of virtual school"
programs. The legislation required the Superintendent of Public Instruction to develop and the
"Virginia Board of Education to approve criteria for approving, monitoring, and, if necessary,"
revoking the approval of multidivision providers of online courses and virtual school programs.
This legislation stipulated that the courses or programs must meet certain requirements with
regard to accreditation and staffing as well as the educational objectives and assessments in the
Virginia Standards of Learning (SOL).
The legislation allowed local school boards to enter into contracts with approved providers to
"offer such courses and programs. As guidance to these boards, the Superintendent of Public"
"Instruction developed model policies and procedures pertaining to student access. In addition, the"
legislation required the Virginia Department of Education to develop a Web site containing
"relevant information, including course content, registration information, teacher qualifications,"
and completion rates. The local boards were required to post information on their Web sites to
"enable visitors to understand and compare various options for learners, including the types of"
"online courses and programs available, conditions under which divisions will pay course fees and"
"other costs for nonresident students, and criteria for granting high school credit."
"In 2011, the Department of Education developed and implemented the multidivision online"
"provider application process, including the Criteria for Approval of Multidivision Online"
"Providers and the application, appeal, and monitoring process approved by the Board of"
"Education. During this initial application period, 13 organizations were approved to offer online"
instruction as multidivision online providers. During the second year of program
"implementation, the legislation required monitoring of the approved providers and the reopening"
of the application window.
"The second application window was opened on January 3, 2012, with provider applications"
"accepted for 30 days. During that time, seven organizations submitted new applications and"
"course correlation documents, and providers approved in 2011 submitted new courses for review"
"and approval. After a thorough review, six of the new applicants were approved as multidivision"
"online providers. For the one application not approved, review teams noted significant"
"deficiencies in data collection and reporting capabilities, pupil performance standards, Section"
"508 compliance, teacher licensure requirements, and correlation to the SOL."
"A third 30-day application window opened on January 2, 2013. During that time, four"
"organizations submitted new applications and course correlation documents, and providers"
approved in 2011 and 2012 submitted new courses for review and approval. After a thorough
"review, the four new applicants were approved as multidivision online providers."
Ten of the 19 organizations approved in 2011or 2012 offered courses to students in Virginia
during the 2012-13 school year. These organizations completed monitoring reports in June 2013.
87
After reviewing data from these reports and conducting monitoring interviews with the,
"providers, the Department of Education has identified three primary issues of concern: some",
"approved providers are offering courses that have not been approved, some school divisions are","approved providers are offering courses that have not been approved, some school divisions are"
not providing information on their Web sites about the approved multidivision online provider,
"courses, and discrepancies exist between data submitted by providers and data reported in the",
Student Records Collection (SRC). These issues are detailed in this report.,
,Activities during the Reporting Period
"The following is a list of key activities that occurred between November 1, 2012 and October 1,","The following is a list of key activities that occurred between November 1, 2012 and October 1,"
2013:,
,"The application window was opened for 30 days beginning January 2, 2013. Applications"
,were received from four organizations.
,"Applications were subjected to an extensive review by career and technical education,"
,"policy, instruction, special education, information management, technology, and finance"
,staff in the Department of Education.
,"All four organizations were approved to offer online instruction, contingent upon the"
,"submission of additional information in the areas of teacher licensure, Section 508"
,"compliance, and data reporting. A summary of approved providers and the courses for"
,which they have been approved to offer is shown in this report.
,"Of the 278 courses reviewed for correlation to the SOL, 103 were approved during the"
,application period. Providers were given the opportunity to submit additional correlation
,information for courses that did not receive initial approval.
,The Department of Education required approved providers to complete monitoring
,reports that detailed their activities in the Commonwealth during the 2012-13 academic
,year.
,The Department of Education conducted monitoring interviews with nine of the ten
,providers that offered courses during the 2012-13 school year: Apex Learning; BYU
,"Independent Study; Connections Academy, LLC; Edgenuity (formerly known as"
,"Education2020, Inc.); EdOptions Online Academy; FLVS Global School; K12, Inc.; The"
,VHS Collaborative; and York County School Division. CCPS Online – Chesterfield
,County Public Schools offered courses to students residing in the division only during the
,"2012-13 school year; as such, a monitoring interview was not deemed necessary."
,"The Assistant Superintendent of Technology, Career and Adult Education detailed"
,findings from the monitoring reports and interviews in letters to each provider. Providers
,with deficiencies in 2012 were allowed 10 business days to address these deficiencies.
,"Providers addressed the deficiencies within the required time. Based upon 2013 findings,"
,six of the nine issues from 2012 were resolved. The status of the three remaining issues
,that reoccurred is discussed later in this report in the Issues and Challenges section.
