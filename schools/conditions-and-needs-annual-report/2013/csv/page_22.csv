,
,also support individualized curriculum to result in appropriate employment and
,independent living skills for students who do not pursue postsecondary education. The
,Board will continue to support the need to address transition issues as early as possible
,across all areas in a student with disabilities’ school career.
,There is some concern about ambiguity in the Standards of Quality as it relates to class
,"size. The SOQ, as written in the Code of Virginia, does not provide guidance on"
,questions such as the definition of “class” and when students must be counted. The Board
,plans to consider guidance to help school divisions interpret and the Department and
,Board to enforce class size provisions.
,The Code of Virginia allows a substitute to serve for up to 90 teaching days in a teacher
,vacancy (or more if approved by the Superintendent of Public Instruction on a case-by-
,case basis) during one school year. The Board expressed concern regarding the length of
,"time a substitute may serve in a vacancy, given that substitute teachers are not required to"
,hold a license.
,The Board supports reform of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965
,(ESEA) that respects state authority for public education while ensuring policies are
,implemented at the state and local levels that address closing achievement gaps. The
,Board will also continue to seek flexibility from ESEA through a renewal of its waiver of
,certain requirements under the “No Child Left Behind” Act.
,Recognizing the reality that our graduates must compete successfully in a global
,"economy, the Board continues to identify cost-effective ways to measure the"
,achievements of Virginia students on recognized international benchmarks. The state
,accountability system lacks sufficient data to benchmark the performance of its students
,on international tests such as the Programme for International Student Assessment
,(PISA) and the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS). The
,"Board would like to participate in obtaining state-level results from the 2015 PISA, which"
,"would require an appropriation of $600,000 in the next biennial budget."
,The Board’s role in promoting high-quality preschool programs and increasing the
,"number of children served by such programs is limited, but the Board remains dedicated"
,"to nurturing young learners and supportive of the Department’s efforts in this area, as"
,noted in goal four.
,"Many children still face difficult personal circumstances such as high poverty, high crime"
,"in their neighborhoods, lack of parental support, limited English proficiency and other"
,"circumstances that obstruct their learning at school. For instance, the percent of students"
,eligible for free and reduced-price meals has grown from 34.6 percent in 2008-2009 to
,"40.2 percent in 2012-2013. Further, childhood hunger and childhood obesity remain"
,"critical issues for many. High rates of unhealthy behaviors, hunger, and poor nutrition"
,keep some students from focusing on learning.
,Maintaining the capacity of the VDOE staff to implement the constitutional and statutory
,requirements placed on the Board of Education and the Department of Education
,"continues to be a challenge with thin resources, particularly in keeping up with"
,increasingly burdensome and time-consuming federal reporting and accountability
,"requirements. A recent study, “State Education Agencies as Agents of Change,” co-"
,"published by the Center for American Progress and the American Enterprise Institute,"
,reported Virginia’s Department of Education staff to pupil ratio as the third lowest in the
,nation. Maintaining high expectations and turning around low-performing schools will
,"require a strong, well-funded VDOE presence."
