B. The Superintendent of Public Instruction shall develop and the Board of Education shall approve criteria for
determining and recognizing educational performance in the Commonwealth's public school divisions and schools.
"Such criteria, when approved, shall become an integral part of the accreditation process and shall include student"
outcome measurements. The Superintendent of Public Instruction shall annually identify to the Board those school
divisions and schools that exceed or do not meet the approved criteria. Such identification shall include an analysis
of the strengths and weaknesses of public education programs in the various school divisions in Virginia and
recommendations to the General Assembly for further enhancing student learning uniformly across the
"Commonwealth. In recognizing educational performance in the school divisions, the Board shall include"
"consideration of special school division accomplishments, such as numbers of dual enrollments and students in"
"Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate courses, and participation in academic year Governor's"
Schools.
The Superintendent of Public Instruction shall assist local school boards in the implementation of action plans for
increasing educational performance in those school divisions and schools that are identified as not meeting the
approved criteria. The Superintendent of Public Instruction shall monitor the implementation of and report to the
Board of Education on the effectiveness of the corrective actions taken to improve the educational performance in
such school divisions and schools.
"C. With such funds as are available for this purpose, the Board of Education shall prescribe assessment methods to"
determine the level of achievement of the Standards of Learning objectives by all students. Such assessments shall
"evaluate knowledge, application of knowledge, critical thinking, and skills related to the Standards of Learning"
being assessed. The Board shall (i) in consultation with the chairpersons of the eight regional superintendents' study
"groups, establish a timetable for administering the Standards of Learning assessments to ensure genuine end-of-"
"course and end-of-grade testing and (ii) with the assistance of independent testing experts, conduct a regular analysis"
and validation process for these assessments.
"In prescribing such Standards of Learning assessments, the Board shall provide local school boards the option of"
"administering tests for United States History to 1877, United States History: 1877 to the Present, and Civics and"
Economics. The last administration of the cumulative grade eight history test will be during the 2007-2008 academic
"school year. Beginning with the 2008-2009 academic year, all school divisions shall administer the United States"
"History to 1877, United States History: 1877 to the Present, and Civics and Economics tests. The Board shall also"
provide the option of industry certification and state licensure examinations as a student-selected verified credit.
The Board of Education shall make publicly available such assessments in a timely manner and as soon as
"practicable following the administration of such tests, so long as the release of such assessments does not"
