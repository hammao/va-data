"compromise test security or deplete the bank of assessment questions necessary to construct subsequent tests, or"
limit the ability to test students on demand and provide immediate results in the web-based assessment system.
The Board shall include in the student outcome measures that are required by the Standards for Accreditation end-
"of-course or end-of-grade tests for various grade levels and classes, as determined by the Board, in accordance with"
"the Standards of Learning. These Standards of Learning assessments shall include, but need not be limited to, end-"
"of-course or end-of-grade tests for English, mathematics, science, and history and social science. Local school"
divisions shall provide targeted mathematics remediation and intervention to students in grades six through eight
who show computational deficiencies as demonstrated by their individual performance on any diagnostic test or
grade-level Standards of Learning mathematics test that measures non-calculator computational skills.
"In addition, to assess the educational progress of students, the Board of Education shall (a) develop appropriate"
"assessments, which may include criterion-referenced tests and alternative assessment instruments that may be used"
by classroom teachers; (b) select appropriate industry certification and state licensure examinations; and (c)
"prescribe and provide measures, which may include nationally normed tests to be used to identify students who"
score in the bottom quartile at selected grade levels. An annual justification that includes evidence that the student
meets the participation criteria defined by the Virginia Department of Education shall be provided for each student
considered for the Virginia Grade Level Alternative. Each Individual Education Program team shall review such
justification and make the final determination as to whether or not the Virginia Grade Level Alternative is
appropriate for the student. The superintendent and the school board chairman shall certify to the Board of
"Education, as a part of certifying compliance with the Standards of Quality, that there is a justification in the"
Individual Education Program for every student who takes the Virginia Grade Level Alternative. Compliance with
this requirement shall be monitored as a part of the special education monitoring process conducted by the
Department of Education. The Board shall report to the Governor and General Assembly in its annual reports
pursuant to § 22.1-18 any school division that is not in compliance with this requirement.
"The Standards of Learning requirements, including all related assessments, shall be waived for any student awarded"
"a scholarship under the Brown v. Board of Education Scholarship Program, pursuant to § 30-231.2, who is enrolled"
in a preparation program for the General Education Development (GED) certificate or in an adult basic education
program to obtain the high school diploma.
The Board of Education may adopt special provisions related to the administration and use of any Standards of
Learning test or tests in a content area as applied to accreditation ratings for any period during which the Standards
of Learning content or assessments in that area are being revised and phased in. Prior to statewide administration of
"such tests, the Board of Education shall provide notice to local school boards regarding such special provisions."
