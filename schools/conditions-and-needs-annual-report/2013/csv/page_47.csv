"B. The Board of Education shall establish educational objectives known as the Standards of Learning, which shall"
"form the core of Virginia's educational program, and other educational objectives, which together are designed to"
ensure the development of the skills that are necessary for success in school and for preparation for life in the years
"beyond. At a minimum, the Board shall establish Standards of Learning for English, mathematics, science, and"
history and social science. The Standards of Learning shall not be construed to be regulations as defined in § 2.2-
4001.
The Board shall seek to ensure that the Standards of Learning are consistent with a high-quality foundation
"educational program. The Standards of Learning shall include, but not be limited to, the basic skills of"
"communication (listening, speaking, reading, and writing); computation and critical reasoning, including problem"
solving and decision making; proficiency in the use of computers and related technology; and the skills to manage
personal finances and to make sound financial decisions.
The English Standards of Learning for reading in kindergarten through grade three shall be based on components of
"effective reading instruction, to include, at a minimum, phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary"
"development, and text comprehension."
The Standards of Learning in all subject areas shall be subject to regular review and revision to maintain rigor and to
reflect a balance between content knowledge and the application of knowledge in preparation for eventual
"employment and lifelong learning. The Board of Education shall establish a regular schedule, in a manner it deems"
"appropriate, for the review, and revision as may be necessary, of the Standards of Learning in all subject areas. Such"
review of each subject area shall occur at least once every seven years. Nothing in this section shall be construed to
prohibit the Board from conducting such review and revision on a more frequent basis.
"To provide appropriate opportunity for input from the general public, teachers, and local school boards, the Board of"
Education shall conduct public hearings prior to establishing revised Standards of Learning. Thirty days prior to
"conducting such hearings, the Board shall give notice of the date, time, and place of the hearings to all local school"
boards and any other persons requesting to be notified of the hearings and publish notice of its intention to revise the
Standards of Learning in the Virginia Register of Regulations. Interested parties shall be given reasonable
opportunity to be heard and present information prior to final adoption of any revisions of the Standards of Learning.
"In addition, the Department of Education shall make available and maintain a website, either separately or through"
"an existing website utilized by the Department of Education, enabling public elementary, middle, and high school"
"educators to submit recommendations for improvements relating to the Standards of Learning, when under review"
