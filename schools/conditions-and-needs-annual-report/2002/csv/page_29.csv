Remediation programs:
"In 2000, the Board of Education established a voluntary Remediation Recovery Program that"
provides accreditation credit for schools that successfully remediate students who initially failed the
Standards of Learning tests in English and mathematics.
Special education programs:
"During the past three years, programs for special education students were improved by establishing"
"the Modified Standard Diploma, implementing the Virginia Alternative Assessment Program, and"
refining the special education complaint appeal procedures. The Board set guidelines for the
participation of students with disabilities in the assessment component of Virginia’s accountability
system and devised an alternative Standards of Learning assessment and evaluation program for
students with disabilities.
Support from the Governor and General Assembly
The Governor’s PASS program:
"In light of the pressing needs expressed by school divisions, the Board of Education is gratified that"
Governor Mark R. Warner has developed and initiated a comprehensive effort to improve student
achievement. The Governor’s Partnership for Achieving Successful Schools (PASS) was launched
by Governor Warner to improve student achievement in Virginia’s lowest academically performing
schools. The PASS program will assist 117 academically warned schools statewide with a
"comprehensive plan to marshal community and business support. These schools, which have been"
"Accredited with Warning due to student performance on Standards of Learning exams, will receive"
"enhanced services from visiting academic review teams consisting of principals, teachers and retired"
"educators. In addition, the Governor has designated 34 of these schools as PASS Priority Schools."
"They will receive additional intervention and follow-up to track the progress made by students,"
"teachers, and administrators. The PASS program also places emphasis on building productive"
partnerships with the school and the community.
Standards of Learning technology initiative:
In addition to the General Assembly’s support in providing increased basic aid and categorical
"funding for public education, the General Assembly has provided funding for an important"
technology initiative. The Board of Education is gratified by the support of the General Assembly
for this important program. The intent of this initiative is to use Web-enabled systems to improve
"Standards of Learning instructional, remedial, and testing capabilities of high schools. The General"
Assembly provided funding for this program in order to achieve three general goals in each high
school: provide student access to computers with a ratio of one computer for every five students;
"create Internet-ready local area network capability in every school; and assure adequate high speed,"
"high bandwidth capability for instructional, remedial, and testing needs."
