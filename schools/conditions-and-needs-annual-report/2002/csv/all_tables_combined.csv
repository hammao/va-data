Executive Summary,
The 2002 Annual Report on the Condition and Needs of the Public Schools in Virginia provides a concise but,The 2002 Annual Report on the Condition and Needs of the Public Schools in Virginia provides a concise but
comprehensive picture of the current condition and needs of the public schools. During the past,
"several years, public schools throughout Virginia have overcome many challenges to educational",
"progress. This has truly been a team effort involving the Governor, the General Assembly,",
"educators, parents, and communities. Strong leadership, hard work, and perseverance have moved",
many Virginia schools forward. The members of the Board of Education are grateful for this,
cooperative effort and have the confidence that all schools have the capacity for continuous,
improvement and academic excellence.,
The 2002 Annual Report on the Condition and Needs of the Public Schools in Virginia points out that,
Virginia’s students are performing better academically as a result of the statewide school,
improvement efforts. Substantial gains have been made in key subject areas on the standardized tests,improvement efforts. Substantial gains have been made in key subject areas on the standardized tests
that are designed to measure performance against Virginia’s learning standards. Students have,
begun to show impressive gains on national tests that are designed to measure skills and content.,
"Schools, too, are improving. Statewide, the overall performance of schools has improved steadily",
"since 1998, the first year of the Standards of Learning testing. In fact, many schools have already",
reached the long-term performance goal of full accreditation.,
This annual report also describes some of the challenges facing our public schools and our students.,This annual report also describes some of the challenges facing our public schools and our students.
"For at least the near future, Virginia will experience unprecedented fiscal stress at the state level.",In

"For example, Standards of Learning scores show that at Grade 3, the reading pass rate has improved","For example, Standards of Learning scores show that at Grade 3, the reading pass rate has improved"
"by 17 percentage points over the past five years, but more than one in four children still cannot pass","by 17 percentage points over the past five years, but more than one in four children still cannot pass"
"the Grade 3 reading test. In Grade 8, by which time children should be proficient readers, nearly",
one in three still are failing the Standards of Learning reading test. The lack of more substantial,
"progress in reading is unacceptable, especially given the significant financial resources that the",
commonwealth has devoted over the past six years to programs such as the Early Reading,
Intervention program.,
"Though improvement is seen with each year’s testing, there remains a persistent and troubling",
achievement gap among groups of students. Virginia demographic data show increases in our,
"special populations during the past few years: special education, students with limited English",
"proficiency, and gifted students. Many of these students need costly, intensive instructional support","proficiency, and gifted students. Many of these students need costly, intensive instructional support"
"to succeed in school. As required by the Virginia Code, this report lists the schools and school",
divisions that report noncompliance with some of the most basic requirements of schools and,
school divisions contained in the Standards of Quality and the Standards of Accreditation.,
"Another challenge that Virginia’s schools face is the need to recruit, hire, train, and retain highly",
qualified teachers for all of Virginia’s public school classrooms. Even though the average Virginia,
"teacher salary is ranked twenty-fourth among the 50 states, we must redouble efforts to attract and",
"retain a high quality work force, especially in light of the new No Child Left Behind requirements.",
,4
As a key part of the Board of Education’s efforts to engage local officials in the upcoming revisions
"of the Standards of Quality, the Board held a series of 10 public hearings in 2002. Local school and"
community leaders spoke candidly of their concerns about the condition and needs of public
schools. The major recommendations raised in these hearings are summarized in the text of this
report.
The 2002 Annual Report on the Condition and Needs of Public Schools in Virginia is intended to be viewed
along with two additional documents: the Board of Education Six-Year Plan: 2003-08 and the Six-
"Year Plan for Technology. Together, these three documents provide a comprehensive view of the"
"Board’s six-year priorities, the condition and needs upon which the priorities are based, and the"
future direction and needs of our system of public education.
The members of the Board of Education are committed to the goal of high academic achievement
"for all students. Our students can be competitive, and many objective measures indicate that is true."
"Virginians should be proud that our schools, our students, and our teachers have stayed the course."

National Assessment of Educational Progress: The nation’s report card:,
"In 2000, the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) released the latest grade 4 and",
grade 8 mathematics test scores. Virginia students made significant gains compared to the last,
NAEP mathematics test given in 1996 just as the Standards of Learning program was starting.,
"Virginia fourth-graders made the second greatest improvement in the nation, and our eighth-graders",
made the third greatest improvement in the nation. Except for the 1996 eighth grade mathematics,
"score (which was one point below the nation), Virginia students’ scores in the NAEP mathematics","score (which was one point below the nation), Virginia students’ scores in the NAEP mathematics"
tests have exceeded the national average in every year tested.,
Key findings of the NAEP mathematics test in 2000:,
For grade 4:,
•,The average score for students in Virginia was the highest ever.
•,"Students’ scale scores in Virginia were higher than those in 22 jurisdictions, not significantly"
,"different from those in 19 jurisdictions, and lower than those in 4 jurisdictions."
•,The percentage of students who performed at or above the Proficient level was 25 percent.

noncompliance.,The areas of noncompliance are as follows
,22
"Standard 1: Basic skills, selected programs, and instructional personnel:"
The second most frequently cited deficiency last year (2000-01) was noncompliance with the
standard that requires a local school board to report annually to the public on or before January 1
the division’s pupil-teacher ratio in elementary schools.
"Standard 3: Accreditation, other standards and evaluation:"
Standard 3 of the Standards of Quality requires that local school boards maintain schools accredited
in accordance with standards adopted by the Board of Education. This is interpreted to mean rated
"Fully Accredited. Although most school divisions do not have all of their schools rated Fully Accredited,"
"few reported this as a noncompliance issue. The cities of Falls Church, Lexington, and Poquoson,"
along with the town of West Point were the only school divisions that had all of their schools rated
Fully Accredited in the 2001-02 school year.
Standard 6: Planning and public involvement:
The standard cited most often was the standard that requires the local school board to have an up-
to-date six-year school improvement plan. A number of divisions indicated that their six-year plans
were in various stages of revision or development.
Standard 7: Policy manual:
The standard that requires a review of each division’s policy manual and announcement of its
availability to the public was the second most cited area of noncompliance. Most divisions reported
that they subscribe to the policy service offered by the Virginia School Boards Association (VSBA)
and that policies were reviewed on an on-going basis in board meetings. Most provided evidence to
"support this practice, but few provided evidence that the policy manual was reviewed with the input"
"of teachers, parents, and other concerned citizens."
Standard 8 of the Standards of Quality gives the Board of Education the authority to seek
compliance with the Standards of Quality through the Office of the Attorney General if a division
continues to fail to comply with any standard. No such action is required for the 2000-01 school
year.
"The state Board of Correctional Education and the Department of Correctional Education, although"
not a local school board or education agency subject to the requirements of the Standards of
"Quality, have developed an extensive plan to meet all of the requirements of these standards."
Accreditation status of the public schools: 2001-02
Students in nearly eight out of ten Virginia schools met or exceeded state achievement goals on
"Standards of Learning tests in English, mathematics, history and social science, and science"
administered during the 2001-02 school year.
"In 2002, 64 percent, or 1,175, of the commonwealth’s 1,830 schools, met or exceeded the standard"
"for full accreditation. Last year, 40 percent, or 731 of the state’s public schools, met the eventual"
"standard for full accreditation. Fourteen percent, or 257 of the state’s public schools, fell short of"
full accreditation but met or surpassed annual achievement benchmarks established by the Board of
Education.

The NCLB Act of 2001 places major emphasis upon teacher quality as a factor in improving student
achievement. Title I of the ESEA requires that all teachers of core academic subjects hired after the
"first day of the 2002–2003 school year and teaching in a program supported with Title I, Part A,"
funds be “highly qualified.” States are required to develop plans with annual measurable objectives
that will ensure that all teachers who teach in core academic subjects are highly qualified by the end
"of the 2005-2006 school year. ""Highly qualified"" in this context means that the teacher: (1) holds"
"full state licensure as a teacher, including licensure through alternate routes; and (2) teaches only in"
"the area or areas of endorsement. ""Highly qualified"" applies to all teachers working in core academic"
subjects by the end of the 2005-2006 school year. The legislation defines the following areas as core
"academic subjects: English, reading or language arts, mathematics, science, foreign language, civics"
"and government, economics, arts, history, and geography."
The Board of Education responds:
Programs to meet the needs of schools and students
"The Board of Education, keenly aware of the conditions and needs of our public schools, has put in"
place many new and effective school improvement programs during the past several years.
"Addressing the conditions and needs as identified through the recent public engagement process, the"
highlights of Board actions include the following initiatives and programs.
"Attracting, hiring, and retaining qualified educators:"
"To ensure that Virginia has a supply of qualified teachers in the future, the Board of Education and"
the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia established the Committee to Enhance the K-12
Teaching Profession. The action plan developed by this committee will help efforts to increase the
pool of highly qualified personnel and to support the teachers who are already in the school systems.
"Virginia recently received a $13.5 million federal grant, which will be used to implement the"
"committee’s action plan. The work of this committee, with the resources provided by the federal"
"grant, will be a tremendous boost to the teaching profession in Virginia."
"Other actions include the identification of teacher shortage areas, expansion of the career switcher"
"and alternative routes to licensure, setting standards governing the issuance of a license to"
"individuals holding a local eligibility license, setting the passing scores for Praxis II beginning teacher"
"assessment in content areas, adopting new provisions for the licensure regulations, and the"
regulations for approved teacher preparation programs.
Instructional programs to meet individual needs:
"Board actions included revising the Standards of Learning in several core content areas, all geared to"
making the Standards of Learning program a better and more effective tool for student learning.
The Board placed special emphasis on developing policies and programs to help schools meet the
"individual needs and special circumstances of a diversity of students, such as non-English speaking,"
"special education, GED students, career and technical students, and adults."
Keeping the Standards of Learning up-to-date:
The Board has recently revised the Standards of Learning in mathematics and history and social
science. The English and science standards are being reviewed. The Board is also reviewing new
English Language Proficiency (ELP) Standards of Learning for Limited English Proficient (LEP)
27
"Students. In the past two years, revised Standards of Learning in the fine arts, foreign language,"
"health and physical education, and driver education have also been approved by the Board."
Resources for classroom teachers:
Within the past two years the Board of Education and the Virginia Department of Education have
worked to provide classroom teachers with helpful resources. Among the resources developed and
"distributed are the Sample Scope and Sequence Guides for K-12 courses in English, mathematics, science,"
and history and social science. Instructional models that have proven to be successful with low-
"achieving students were approved, and a Leadership Development Curriculum was adopted."
A firm foundation for reading:
"Recognizing the seminal importance of reading, the Board of Education’s Committee to Implement"
the No Child Left Behind Act has initiated a comprehensive study of reading and reading instruction in
Virginia’s public schools. The recommendations from the study will be instrumental in influencing
"policies such as new teacher licensure standards in reading, new content and performance standards"
"in English Standards of Learning, and other instructional initiatives."
Adult education and literacy:
"Services for the adult learner included basic literacy programs, adult secondary programs, English for"
"speakers of other languages, and skill-based programs in the workplace. Also, the Board of"
Education has established the Advisory Committee on Adult Education and Literacy to help the
Board stay focused on the needs of adults and those who will benefit from family literacy programs.
Appropriate recognition for Career and Technical Education:
"At the urging of the Governor, and in recognition of the rigorous content of the career and"
"technical certification exams, the Board approved guidelines for awarding differentiated numbers of"
verified credits for career and technical education certification and licensure examinations. This
enables students who pass a board-approved certification or licensure examination to earn one or
"two student-selected verified credits in career and technical education, depending on the course of"
study taken in preparation for the examination.
The Board gave added flexibility to school divisions to address the individual student needs
"regarding the Standards of Learning testing program. In a major policy move, the Board approved"
"the provisions for the local award of verified credit for transition students. Also, the Board"
continues to review and revise the extensive listing of substitute tests available for earning verified
"credit, expedited retesting, and unlimited retests. With the use of substitute tests and examinations"
"for certification and licenses, students-especially those in the transition years who have not had the"
full benefit of the Standards of Learning program-have multiple options for earning the verified
credits needed for high school graduation (Appendix F).
Academic Review program:
"The Board continues to refine the Standards of Learning, assessment, and accreditation programs."
"Actions include expanding the academic review programs for struggling schools, and putting"
remediation programs in place to help students. The Academic Review teams monitor schools rated
Accredited with Warning in specific academic areas as required under the amended accreditation
standards.
28
Remediation programs:
"In 2000, the Board of Education established a voluntary Remediation Recovery Program that"
provides accreditation credit for schools that successfully remediate students who initially failed the
Standards of Learning tests in English and mathematics.
Special education programs:
"During the past three years, programs for special education students were improved by establishing"
"the Modified Standard Diploma, implementing the Virginia Alternative Assessment Program, and"
refining the special education complaint appeal procedures. The Board set guidelines for the
participation of students with disabilities in the assessment component of Virginia’s accountability
system and devised an alternative Standards of Learning assessment and evaluation program for
students with disabilities.
Support from the Governor and General Assembly
The Governor’s PASS program:
"In light of the pressing needs expressed by school divisions, the Board of Education is gratified that"
Governor Mark R. Warner has developed and initiated a comprehensive effort to improve student
achievement. The Governor’s Partnership for Achieving Successful Schools (PASS) was launched
by Governor Warner to improve student achievement in Virginia’s lowest academically performing
schools. The PASS program will assist 117 academically warned schools statewide with a
"comprehensive plan to marshal community and business support. These schools, which have been"
"Accredited with Warning due to student performance on Standards of Learning exams, will receive"
"enhanced services from visiting academic review teams consisting of principals, teachers and retired"
"educators. In addition, the Governor has designated 34 of these schools as PASS Priority Schools."
"They will receive additional intervention and follow-up to track the progress made by students,"
"teachers, and administrators. The PASS program also places emphasis on building productive"
partnerships with the school and the community.
Standards of Learning technology initiative:
In addition to the General Assembly’s support in providing increased basic aid and categorical
"funding for public education, the General Assembly has provided funding for an important"
technology initiative. The Board of Education is gratified by the support of the General Assembly
for this important program. The intent of this initiative is to use Web-enabled systems to improve
"Standards of Learning instructional, remedial, and testing capabilities of high schools. The General"
Assembly provided funding for this program in order to achieve three general goals in each high
school: provide student access to computers with a ratio of one computer for every five students;
"create Internet-ready local area network capability in every school; and assure adequate high speed,"
"high bandwidth capability for instructional, remedial, and testing needs."

•,"By the next school year, provide all students enrolled in the school with the option"
,of transferring to another public school that is not under improvement but served by
,"the division, including charter schools. Transportation must be paid."
•,Ensure that a two-year school improvement plan is prepared for approval by the
,school division within three months. This plan must be developed in consultation
,"with parents, school staff, the school division, and outside experts and implemented"
,by the beginning of the next school year.
•,Reserve at least 10 percent of basic aid funds for professional development that
,directly address problems contributing to the need for improvement.
