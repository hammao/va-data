The NCLB Act of 2001 places major emphasis upon teacher quality as a factor in improving student
achievement. Title I of the ESEA requires that all teachers of core academic subjects hired after the
"first day of the 2002–2003 school year and teaching in a program supported with Title I, Part A,"
funds be “highly qualified.” States are required to develop plans with annual measurable objectives
that will ensure that all teachers who teach in core academic subjects are highly qualified by the end
"of the 2005-2006 school year. ""Highly qualified"" in this context means that the teacher: (1) holds"
"full state licensure as a teacher, including licensure through alternate routes; and (2) teaches only in"
"the area or areas of endorsement. ""Highly qualified"" applies to all teachers working in core academic"
subjects by the end of the 2005-2006 school year. The legislation defines the following areas as core
"academic subjects: English, reading or language arts, mathematics, science, foreign language, civics"
"and government, economics, arts, history, and geography."
The Board of Education responds:
Programs to meet the needs of schools and students
"The Board of Education, keenly aware of the conditions and needs of our public schools, has put in"
place many new and effective school improvement programs during the past several years.
"Addressing the conditions and needs as identified through the recent public engagement process, the"
highlights of Board actions include the following initiatives and programs.
"Attracting, hiring, and retaining qualified educators:"
"To ensure that Virginia has a supply of qualified teachers in the future, the Board of Education and"
the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia established the Committee to Enhance the K-12
Teaching Profession. The action plan developed by this committee will help efforts to increase the
pool of highly qualified personnel and to support the teachers who are already in the school systems.
"Virginia recently received a $13.5 million federal grant, which will be used to implement the"
"committee’s action plan. The work of this committee, with the resources provided by the federal"
"grant, will be a tremendous boost to the teaching profession in Virginia."
"Other actions include the identification of teacher shortage areas, expansion of the career switcher"
"and alternative routes to licensure, setting standards governing the issuance of a license to"
"individuals holding a local eligibility license, setting the passing scores for Praxis II beginning teacher"
"assessment in content areas, adopting new provisions for the licensure regulations, and the"
regulations for approved teacher preparation programs.
Instructional programs to meet individual needs:
"Board actions included revising the Standards of Learning in several core content areas, all geared to"
making the Standards of Learning program a better and more effective tool for student learning.
The Board placed special emphasis on developing policies and programs to help schools meet the
"individual needs and special circumstances of a diversity of students, such as non-English speaking,"
"special education, GED students, career and technical students, and adults."
Keeping the Standards of Learning up-to-date:
The Board has recently revised the Standards of Learning in mathematics and history and social
science. The English and science standards are being reviewed. The Board is also reviewing new
English Language Proficiency (ELP) Standards of Learning for Limited English Proficient (LEP)
