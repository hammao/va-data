"Students. In the past two years, revised Standards of Learning in the fine arts, foreign language,"
"health and physical education, and driver education have also been approved by the Board."
Resources for classroom teachers:
Within the past two years the Board of Education and the Virginia Department of Education have
worked to provide classroom teachers with helpful resources. Among the resources developed and
"distributed are the Sample Scope and Sequence Guides for K-12 courses in English, mathematics, science,"
and history and social science. Instructional models that have proven to be successful with low-
"achieving students were approved, and a Leadership Development Curriculum was adopted."
A firm foundation for reading:
"Recognizing the seminal importance of reading, the Board of Education’s Committee to Implement"
the No Child Left Behind Act has initiated a comprehensive study of reading and reading instruction in
Virginia’s public schools. The recommendations from the study will be instrumental in influencing
"policies such as new teacher licensure standards in reading, new content and performance standards"
"in English Standards of Learning, and other instructional initiatives."
Adult education and literacy:
"Services for the adult learner included basic literacy programs, adult secondary programs, English for"
"speakers of other languages, and skill-based programs in the workplace. Also, the Board of"
Education has established the Advisory Committee on Adult Education and Literacy to help the
Board stay focused on the needs of adults and those who will benefit from family literacy programs.
Appropriate recognition for Career and Technical Education:
"At the urging of the Governor, and in recognition of the rigorous content of the career and"
"technical certification exams, the Board approved guidelines for awarding differentiated numbers of"
verified credits for career and technical education certification and licensure examinations. This
enables students who pass a board-approved certification or licensure examination to earn one or
"two student-selected verified credits in career and technical education, depending on the course of"
study taken in preparation for the examination.
The Board gave added flexibility to school divisions to address the individual student needs
"regarding the Standards of Learning testing program. In a major policy move, the Board approved"
"the provisions for the local award of verified credit for transition students. Also, the Board"
continues to review and revise the extensive listing of substitute tests available for earning verified
"credit, expedited retesting, and unlimited retests. With the use of substitute tests and examinations"
"for certification and licenses, students-especially those in the transition years who have not had the"
full benefit of the Standards of Learning program-have multiple options for earning the verified
credits needed for high school graduation (Appendix F).
Academic Review program:
"The Board continues to refine the Standards of Learning, assessment, and accreditation programs."
"Actions include expanding the academic review programs for struggling schools, and putting"
remediation programs in place to help students. The Academic Review teams monitor schools rated
Accredited with Warning in specific academic areas as required under the amended accreditation
standards.
