"Standard 1: Basic skills, selected programs, and instructional personnel:"
The second most frequently cited deficiency last year (2000-01) was noncompliance with the
standard that requires a local school board to report annually to the public on or before January 1
the division’s pupil-teacher ratio in elementary schools.
"Standard 3: Accreditation, other standards and evaluation:"
Standard 3 of the Standards of Quality requires that local school boards maintain schools accredited
in accordance with standards adopted by the Board of Education. This is interpreted to mean rated
"Fully Accredited. Although most school divisions do not have all of their schools rated Fully Accredited,"
"few reported this as a noncompliance issue. The cities of Falls Church, Lexington, and Poquoson,"
along with the town of West Point were the only school divisions that had all of their schools rated
Fully Accredited in the 2001-02 school year.
Standard 6: Planning and public involvement:
The standard cited most often was the standard that requires the local school board to have an up-
to-date six-year school improvement plan. A number of divisions indicated that their six-year plans
were in various stages of revision or development.
Standard 7: Policy manual:
The standard that requires a review of each division’s policy manual and announcement of its
availability to the public was the second most cited area of noncompliance. Most divisions reported
that they subscribe to the policy service offered by the Virginia School Boards Association (VSBA)
and that policies were reviewed on an on-going basis in board meetings. Most provided evidence to
"support this practice, but few provided evidence that the policy manual was reviewed with the input"
"of teachers, parents, and other concerned citizens."
Standard 8 of the Standards of Quality gives the Board of Education the authority to seek
compliance with the Standards of Quality through the Office of the Attorney General if a division
continues to fail to comply with any standard. No such action is required for the 2000-01 school
year.
"The state Board of Correctional Education and the Department of Correctional Education, although"
not a local school board or education agency subject to the requirements of the Standards of
"Quality, have developed an extensive plan to meet all of the requirements of these standards."
Accreditation status of the public schools: 2001-02
Students in nearly eight out of ten Virginia schools met or exceeded state achievement goals on
"Standards of Learning tests in English, mathematics, history and social science, and science"
administered during the 2001-02 school year.
"In 2002, 64 percent, or 1,175, of the commonwealth’s 1,830 schools, met or exceeded the standard"
"for full accreditation. Last year, 40 percent, or 731 of the state’s public schools, met the eventual"
"standard for full accreditation. Fourteen percent, or 257 of the state’s public schools, fell short of"
full accreditation but met or surpassed annual achievement benchmarks established by the Board of
Education.
