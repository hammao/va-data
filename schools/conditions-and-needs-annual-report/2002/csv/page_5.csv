As a key part of the Board of Education’s efforts to engage local officials in the upcoming revisions
"of the Standards of Quality, the Board held a series of 10 public hearings in 2002. Local school and"
community leaders spoke candidly of their concerns about the condition and needs of public
schools. The major recommendations raised in these hearings are summarized in the text of this
report.
The 2002 Annual Report on the Condition and Needs of Public Schools in Virginia is intended to be viewed
along with two additional documents: the Board of Education Six-Year Plan: 2003-08 and the Six-
"Year Plan for Technology. Together, these three documents provide a comprehensive view of the"
"Board’s six-year priorities, the condition and needs upon which the priorities are based, and the"
future direction and needs of our system of public education.
The members of the Board of Education are committed to the goal of high academic achievement
"for all students. Our students can be competitive, and many objective measures indicate that is true."
"Virginians should be proud that our schools, our students, and our teachers have stayed the course."
