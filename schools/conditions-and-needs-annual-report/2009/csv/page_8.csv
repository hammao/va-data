,
•,Addressing student needs in light of a persistent poverty rate that exists for children and
,"their families, which makes these children more likely to be sick as toddlers, unprepared for"
,"kindergarten, fall behind in grade school or drop out of high school, and are less likely to be"
,economically successful as adults.
•,Providing programs that address the increase in immigrant students—a large proportion of
,whom are also poor—who are more likely than others to drop out or leave school without
,the skills needed in a global marketplace.
•,"Eliminating gaps in graduation rates and student achievement, although improving, persist"
,among Virginia’s African-American and Hispanic students and their white and Asian
,counterparts.
•,Seeking new and efficient ways to use technology to reduce the testing burden on teachers
,"and students, but to do so in a way that will not reduce accountability standards and that can"
,be accomplished with available funding.
•,Dealing effectively with the realities of schooling for some children who face difficult
,"personal circumstances such as high poverty, high crime in their neighborhoods, high rates"
,"of unhealthy behaviors, poor nutrition, and other circumstances that obstruct their learning"
,at school.
•,Continuing the aggressive interventions by the Virginia Department of Education to assist
,divisions previously identified as low-performing.
•,Finding new and effective ways to help colleges and universities and school divisions in the
,"preparation, recruitment, and retention of teachers and other educational personnel."
•,Making a concerted effort to develop and promote policies to help divisions recruit and
,maintain minority teachers and educational personnel.
•,Maintaining emphasis on quality programs for at-risk four-year-olds across the state in an era
,of reduced resources.
•,"Finding and promoting new and effective ways to involve parents in their child’s education,"
,a critical need that must be addressed if Virginia is to promote safe and healthy school
,"environments, and eliminate achievement gaps."
•,"Helping teachers and administrators at all levels to gather, analyze, and use data to"
,continuously improve teaching and learning—the data analysis work that can lead their
,schools to understand what needs to change to get better results. A further challenge is to
,create new resources for professional development that put usable information into the
,hands of those directly responsible for students’ learning.
