School boards shall implement the Standards of Learning or objectives specifically designed for their school
divisions that are equivalent to or exceed the Board's requirements. Students shall be expected to achieve
the educational objectives established by the school division at appropriate age or grade levels. The
curriculum adopted by the local school division shall be aligned to the Standards of Learning.
The Board of Education shall include in the Standards of Learning for history and social science the study of
"contributions to society of diverse people. For the purposes of this subsection, ""diverse"" shall include"
"consideration of disability, ethnicity, race, and gender."
"With such funds as are made available for this purpose, the Board shall regularly review and revise the"
"competencies for career and technical education programs to require the full integration of English,"
"mathematics, science, and history and social science Standards of Learning. Career and technical"
"education programs shall be aligned with industry and professional standard certifications, where they exist."
C. Local school boards shall develop and implement a program of instruction for grades K through 12 that is
aligned to the Standards of Learning and meets or exceeds the requirements of the Board of Education. The
"program of instruction shall emphasize reading, writing, speaking, mathematical concepts and computations,"
"proficiency in the use of computers and related technology, and scientific concepts and processes; essential"
"skills and concepts of citizenship, including knowledge of Virginia history and world and United States"
"history, economics, government, foreign languages, international cultures, health and physical education,"
environmental issues and geography necessary for responsible participation in American society and in the
"international community; fine arts, which may include, but need not be limited to, music and art, and practical"
"arts; knowledge and skills needed to qualify for further education, gainful employment, or training in a career"
or technical field; and development of the ability to apply such skills and knowledge in preparation for
eventual employment and lifelong learning and to achieve economic self-sufficiency.
"Local school boards shall also develop and implement programs of prevention, intervention, or remediation"
"for students who are educationally at risk including, but not limited to, those who fail to achieve a passing"
score on any Standards of Learning assessment in grades three through eight or who fail an end-of-course
test required for the award of a verified unit of credit. Such programs shall include components that are
research-based.
"Any student who achieves a passing score on one or more, but not all, of the Standards of Learning"
assessments for the relevant grade level in grades three through eight may be required to attend a
remediation program.
Any student who fails to achieve a passing score on all of the Standards of Learning assessments for the
relevant grade level in grades three through eight or who fails an end-of-course test required for the award
of a verified unit of credit shall be required to attend a remediation program or to participate in another form
"of remediation. Division superintendents shall require such students to take special programs of prevention,"
"intervention, or remediation, which may include attendance in public summer school programs, in"
accordance with clause (ii) of subsection A of § 22.1-254 and § 22.1-254.01.
"Remediation programs shall include, when applicable, a procedure for early identification of students who"
are at risk of failing the Standards of Learning assessments in grades three through eight or who fail an end-
of-course test required for the award of a verified unit of credit. Such programs may also include summer
"school for all elementary and middle school grades and for all high school academic courses, as defined by"
"regulations promulgated by the Board of Education, or other forms of remediation. Summer school"
remediation programs or other forms of remediation shall be chosen by the division superintendent to be
appropriate to the academic needs of the student. Students who are required to attend such summer school
programs or to participate in another form of remediation shall not be charged tuition by the school division.
"The requirement for remediation may, however, be satisfied by the student's attendance in a program of"
"prevention, intervention or remediation that has been selected by his parent, in consultation with the division"
"superintendent or his designee, and is either (i) conducted by an accredited private school or (ii) a special"
program that has been determined to be comparable to the required public school remediation program by
the division superintendent. The costs of such private school remediation program or other special
remediation program shall be borne by the student's parent.
The Board of Education shall establish standards for full funding of summer remedial programs that shall
"include, but not be limited to, the minimum number of instructional hours or the equivalent thereof required"
for full funding and an assessment system designed to evaluate program effectiveness. Based on the
"number of students attending and the Commonwealth's share of the per pupil instructional costs, state funds"
shall be provided for the full cost of summer and other remediation programs as set forth in the appropriation
"act, provided such programs comply with such standards as shall be established by the Board, pursuant to §"
22.1-199.2.
