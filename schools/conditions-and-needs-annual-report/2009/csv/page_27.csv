"Each year, staff members of the Department of Education collect self-assessment data from school"
divisions on their compliance with the provisions of §§ 22.1-253.13:1 through 22.1-253.13:8 of the
Code of Virginia (SOQ). The chairman of the school board and division superintendent certify the
level of compliance with the standards and the individual indicators within each standard to the
Department of Education via an electronic data collection system.
"It is important to note that where divisions indicate less than full compliance with the standards,"
corrective action plans for the noncompliance items are required. Of the divisions that were not in
"full compliance, all have filed a corrective action plan. The data are for the 2008-2009 school year"
"and for the SOQ that were in effect as of July 1, 2008."
Compliance with the Requirements of the
Standards of Accreditation
Ninety-eight percent of Virginia’s public schools are fully accredited and meeting state standards for
"achievement in English, mathematics, history and science based on 2008-2009 assessment results."
This is the highest percentage of schools reaching full accreditation since the Commonwealth began
accrediting schools based on student achievement ten years ago.
"Students in 98 percent, or 1,826, of Virginia’s 1,867 schools met or exceeded state objectives on"
Standards of Learning (SOL) tests and other statewide assessments in the four core academic areas
last year. Virginia’s public schools have accomplished what many ten years ago thought was
"impossible. With the sustained support of governors, legislators and policy-makers from both"
"parties, teachers and other educators have met the challenge of higher standards and students are"
achieving at significantly higher levels in nearly every school in the Commonwealth.
The percentage of middle schools achieving full accreditation increased again as the performance of
students on rigorous grade-level mathematics tests introduced four years ago continued to improve.
"Ninety-six percent, or 299, of Virginia’s 312 middle schools are now fully accredited compared with"
87 percent last year and 69 percent two years ago.
All but a handful of schools are now meeting or exceeding state standards even though the rigor of
the Commonwealth’s SOL accountability system has increased. The Board of Education will
maintain its focus on raising achievement in schools that have yet to earn and maintain full
accreditation.
"Appendix E shows the listing of divisions with all schools rated Fully Accredited, schools granted"
"Conditional Accreditation, schools rated Accredited with Warning, and schools rated Accreditation"
Denied.
The accreditation ratings are based on the achievement of students on SOL assessments and
"approved substitute tests in English, mathematics, history and science administered during the"
"summer and fall of 2008 and the spring of 2009, or on overall achievement during the three most"
recent academic years. The results of tests administered in each subject area are combined to
"produce overall school passing percentages in English, mathematics, history and science."
