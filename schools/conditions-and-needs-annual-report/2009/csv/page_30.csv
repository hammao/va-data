,"services” positions into ratios (for example, based on positions per 1,000 students), and"
,including ratios for some or all of the categories in the appropriation act.
•,The feasibility of establishing alternative staffing approaches to provide school divisions with
,additional instructional resources to address identified needs. This could include ratios based
,"on positions per 1,000 students for assistant principals, school counselors, and library-media"
,specialists that would reduce funding “cliffs.” It could also include assigning weights for
,"students who may be at-risk and require additional support, including special education"
,"services, services to English language learners, and services to disadvantaged students."
•,The feasibility of creating a special education incentive fund or other funding methodologies
,to mitigate the perverse incentive of reducing a school division’s special education funding
,when it mainstreams students with disabilities into general education classrooms or uses

,"role of technology in instruction, assessment, and operations since staffing standards were"
,first established in the SOQ.
•,"The feasibility of updating career and technical education staffing ratios, taking into"
