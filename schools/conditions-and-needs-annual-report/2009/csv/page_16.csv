•,Persistent Poverty
,"One in ten Virginians lives in poverty, whether native-born or foreign-born. Children living"
,"in poverty are more likely to be sick as toddlers, unprepared for kindergarten, fall behind in"
,"grade school or drop out of high school, and are less likely to be economically successful as"
,adults.
,"Since 2000, the poverty rate among Virginia’s school-age children has fallen, but not among"
,children in some areas of the state. Poverty distribution is uneven across the state – rural
,counties and central cities have the highest percent of students eligible for free and reduced
,lunch. Slightly more than one-third of public school children are eligible for free and
,"reduced-price lunch, up from less than 30 percent in 2000."
•,Changing Demographics
,"In 1998, Virginia’s public schools enrolled fewer than 27,000 Limited English Proficient"
,"(LEP) students. A decade later (2008) the number had risen to more than 87,000. This"
,"growth is expected to continue for the foreseeable future, placing a significant need for"
,resources for the public schools. Immigrant students—especially those that may also be
,poor—are more likely than others to drop out or leave school without the skills needed in a
,global marketplace.
•,Persistent Achievement Gaps
,This is one of the most pressing challenges that states across this nation face. Virginia is no
,exception. Gaps in graduation rates exist between Virginia’s African-American and Hispanic
,students and their white and Asian counterparts. This is equally true for students who are
,"economically disadvantaged. Although improving, gaps also persist on the statewide"
,assessments among Virginia’s African-American and Hispanic students and their white and
,Asian counterparts. Recent changes in federal education policy have put the spotlight on the
,"achievement gap issue, and schools are struggling to bring all students’ achievement up to"
,high levels.
,"The good news is Virginia is making progress. For example, Virginia boasts one of the"
,"nation's smallest achievement gaps between whites and Hispanics. Here, eighth-grade"
,Hispanic students had the highest NAEP writing scores for Hispanic students in any state.
,The persistent challenge is to accelerate this progress and raise the achievement of all
,students.
•,Availability and Use of Latest Technology
,"At the state level, Virginia is seeking new and efficient ways to use technology to reduce the"
,"testing burden on teachers and students, but to do so in a way that will not reduce"
,accountability standards. The infrastructure for such powerful tools is expensive to develop
,"and maintain. Moreover, technology and connectivity have made changes possible by"
,allowing access by essentially everyone to very large data sets or specialized information at
,any location and at any time. Students in the future will have grown up with these
