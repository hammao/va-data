Assessment Results by Subgroup
The Virginia Assessment Program includes Standards of Learning (SOL) tests and other statewide
"assessments in English, history/social science, mathematics, and science. The tables below provide"
"information for the three most recent years on the achievement of students on these tests, including"
percentages of students who demonstrate proficiency and advanced proficiency. Annual
accountability ratings are based on achievement during the previous academic year or combined
achievement from the three most recent years. Only student subgroups represented are listed.
"Schools, school divisions, and states are rated according to the progress toward the goals of the No"
Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB). This federal law requires states to set annual benchmarks for
"achievement in reading and mathematics leading to 100 percent proficiency by 2014. Schools, school"
"divisions, and states that meet or exceed all annual benchmarks toward this goal are rated as having"
"made adequate yearly progress (AYP). Schools, school divisions, states must test at least 95 percent"
"of students overall, and 95 percent of students in each of the following subgroups: white, black,"
"Hispanic, students with disabilities, limited English proficient students, and students identified as"
disadvantaged. Annual accountability ratings are based on achievement during the previous
academic year or combined achievement from the three most recent years.
