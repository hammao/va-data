The Superintendent of Public Instruction shall assist local school boards in the implementation of action
plans for increasing educational performance in those school divisions and schools that are identified as not
meeting the approved criteria. The Superintendent of Public Instruction shall monitor the implementation of
and report to the Board of Education on the effectiveness of the corrective actions taken to improve the
educational performance in such school divisions and schools.
"C. With such funds as are available for this purpose, the Board of Education shall prescribe assessment"
methods to determine the level of achievement of the Standards of Learning objectives by all students. Such
"assessments shall evaluate knowledge, application of knowledge, critical thinking, and skills related to the"
Standards of Learning being assessed. The Board shall (i) in consultation with the chairpersons of the eight
"regional superintendents' study groups, establish a timetable for administering the Standards of Learning"
assessments to ensure genuine end-of-course and end-of-grade testing and (ii) with the assistance of
"independent testing experts, conduct a regular analysis and validation process for these assessments."
"In prescribing such Standards of Learning assessments, the Board shall provide local school boards the"
"option of administering tests for United States History to 1877, United States History: 1877 to the Present,"
and Civics and Economics. The last administration of the cumulative grade eight history test will be during
"the 2007-2008 academic school year. Beginning with the 2008-2009 academic year, all school divisions"
"shall administer the United States History to 1877, United States History: 1877 to the Present, and Civics"
and Economics tests. The Board shall also provide the option of industry certification and state licensure
examinations as a student-selected verified credit.
The Board of Education shall make publicly available such assessments in a timely manner and as soon as
"practicable following the administration of such tests, so long as the release of such assessments does not"
compromise test security or deplete the bank of assessment questions necessary to construct subsequent
"tests, or limit the ability to test students on demand and provide immediate results in the web-based"
assessment system.
The Board shall include in the student outcome measures that are required by the Standards for
"Accreditation end-of-course or end-of-grade tests for various grade levels and classes, as determined by the"
"Board, in accordance with the Standards of Learning. These Standards of Learning assessments shall"
"include, but need not be limited to, end-of-course or end-of-grade tests for English, mathematics, science,"
and history and social science.
"In addition, to assess the educational progress of students, the Board of Education shall (i) develop"
"appropriate assessments, which may include criterion-referenced tests and alternative assessment"
instruments that may be used by classroom teachers; (ii) select appropriate industry certification and state
"licensure examinations and (iii) prescribe and provide measures, which may include nationally normed tests"
to be used to identify students who score in the bottom quartile at selected grade levels.
"The Standard of Learning requirements, including all related assessments, shall be waived for any student"
"awarded a scholarship under the Brown v. Board of Education Scholarship Program, pursuant to § 30-231.2,"
who is enrolled in a preparation program for the General Education Development (GED) certificate or in an
adult basic education program to obtain the high school diploma.
The Board of Education may adopt special provisions related to the administration and use of any SOL test
or tests in a content area as applied to accreditation ratings for any period during which the SOL content or
"assessments in that area are being revised and phased in. Prior to statewide administration of such tests,"
the Board of Education shall provide notice to local school boards regarding such special provisions.
D. The Board of Education may pursue all available civil remedies pursuant to § 22.1-19.1 or administrative
action pursuant to § 22.1-292.1 for breaches in test security and unauthorized alteration of test materials or
test results.
"The Board may initiate or cause to be initiated a review or investigation of any alleged breach in security,"
"unauthorized alteration, or improper administration of tests by local school board employees responsible for"
the distribution or administration of the tests.
Records and other information furnished to or prepared by the Board during the conduct of a review or
"investigation may be withheld pursuant to subdivision 12 of § 2.2-3705.3. However, this section shall not"
prohibit the disclosure of records to (i) a local school board or division superintendent for the purpose of
2009 Annual Report on Condition and Needs of Public Schools
