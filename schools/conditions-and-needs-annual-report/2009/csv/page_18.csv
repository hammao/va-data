,"Moreover, Virginia’s annual teacher turnover rate is slightly more than nine percent. For"
,"principals and assistant principals, the annual turnover rate is higher, at 10 percent."
,Approximately one-fifth of our teaching force and one-fourth of the principals and assistant
,principals are aged 55 or older—a significant number of teachers and principals now at or
,"nearing full retirement age. When considered as a whole, these demographics mean"
,"challenging times ahead, both short-term and long-term."
•,Recruiting Minority Teachers
,Boosting the diversity of Virginia's teaching staff is crucial at a time when educators are
,worrying about eliminating achievement gaps. The gap between the diversity of students in
,the schools and the ethnic characteristics of the teaching force poses a key question: will
,teachers reflect the tremendous diversity of the students they will serve? Not without a
,"concerted effort. In Virginia, 13 percent of teachers are African-American and 2 percent are"
,"Hispanic, compared with approximately 26 and 9 percent of students, respectively."
•,High-Quality Preschool Programs
,The number of school divisions participating in the Virginia Preschool Initiative has grown
,"from 75 in the 2001-2002 school year, to 114 in the 2008-2009 school year. Also, the"
,"number of children served has grown from 5,966 in 2001-2002 to 15,657 children in 2008-"
,"2009. Despite this growth, the number of at-risk four-year-olds in Virginia continues to be a"
,"concern. Without providing high quality preschool to all at-risk four-year-olds, many at-risk"
,five-year-old children will continue to enter kindergarten without adequate preparation to be
,fully ready to learn.
•,Promoting Parental and Family Involvement
,The family and the home are both critical education institutions where children begin
,"learning long before they start school, and where they spend much of their time after they"
,start school. It stands to reason that involving parents in their child’s education is conducive
,to learning. Such involvement is critical if we are to improve the educational achievement of
,"Virginia’s students, promote safe and healthy school environments, and eliminate"
,"achievement gaps. To do this, schools need to promote and enhance cooperative"
,partnerships in which families are allies in the efforts of teachers and schools.
•,Using Information and Research to Improve Student Learning
,The members of the Board of Education understand the need to take a leadership role to
,strengthen the bridge that connects research to the practice of teaching and learning. Dr.
,"Victoria Bernhardt, a nationally recognized authority in the use of research to improve"
,"student learning, asserts: “The more all staff are involved in collecting and analyzing data,"
,the more they will get involved in implementing the changes demanded by the results.” We
,agree. Finding ways to help teachers and administrators know how to properly interpret and
,use data will go a long way in ensuring that each child succeeds in the classroom.
