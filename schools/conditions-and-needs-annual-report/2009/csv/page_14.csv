Students Again Meet or Exceed Federal Benchmarks
Percentage of Virginia’s Schools Meeting Federal
Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) Benchmarks
2007 through 2009
The percentage of schools making AYP fell as federal benchmarks rose to 81 percent in reading and
"79 percent in mathematics. Nonetheless, the percentage of school divisions making AYP increased"
by six points to 60 percent. Virginia and 71 percent of the Commonwealth’s public schools met or
exceeded all No Child Left Behind (NCLB) objectives based on statewide testing during the 2008-
"2009 school year as student achievement increased in reading, mathematics and other subjects. It"
was the second consecutive year and the fourth time in the last five years that Virginia achieved what
"the federal law describes as “adequate yearly progress,” or AYP, toward 100-percent proficiency for"
"all students in reading and mathematics, the two subjects that are the primary focus of the federal"
law.
Student achievement — especially among minority students — increased overall and in critical areas
such as early reading and middle school mathematics. This continued progress (reflected also in the
NAEP results shown above) reflects improvements in teaching and learning in formerly low-
"performing schools and a data-driven, student-by-student approach to raising achievement."
On-Time Graduation Rate
Virginia is setting a national standard for accuracy in reporting graduation rates in a way that is easily
understood by the public. More than 83 percent of the students in the class of 2009 graduated on
time with a diploma. The 2009 “Virginia On-Time Graduation Rate” of 83.2 percent expresses the
percentage of students who were first-time ninth graders during the 2005-2006 school year and
earned a Board of Education-approved diploma within four years. The 2009 graduation rate is one
point higher than the four-year rate of 82.2 percent for the class of 2008.
