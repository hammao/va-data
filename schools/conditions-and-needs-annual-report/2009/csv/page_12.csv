Advanced Placement (AP) Test Results:
Virginia’s Ranking Among Selected States
2009
Virginia ranks third in the nation in the percentage of high school seniors earning a grade of three or
"better on AP exams. In 2008, the number of Virginia public school students who took at least one"
AP test increased by 8.8 percent. Students who earn scores of 3 or above are generally considered
to be qualified to receive college credit and/or placement into advanced courses.
Virginia Ranks Third in International Baccalaureate (IB) Programs
Virginia is among the states that continue to expand student access and participation in the
"International Baccalaureate (IB) program. IB encompasses a comprehensive, two-year curriculum,"
"along with community service and an independent project. To earn an IB diploma, students must"
"successfully pass examinations in literature, a foreign language, social studies, mathematics,"
"experimental sciences, and the arts. They also must write a 4,000-word essay, complete a theory"
"course that hones critical thinking skills, and perform community service. The exams are graded by"
teachers across the globe and compared against the results of thousands of students in 131
countries.
"According to a 2009 report from the Southern Region Education Board (SREB), IB programs are"
"blooming across the U.S. California leads all states with 68 programs, followed by Florida with 49,"
"and then New York and Virginia, which each have 35. In 2008, 1,278 Virginia high school seniors"
"received an IB diploma. This compares to 1,080 in 2007. In addition to the high school diploma"
"programs, the International Baccalaureate organization offers middle year and primary programs,"
"which are growing at a rate faster than the high diploma program. In fact, the primary program is"
"the fastest-growing program within the IB offerings. According to the IB organization, 5 Virginia"
public schools now offer the primary program and 32 schools offer the middle year program. A
"number of additional schools are now developing IB middle level and primary programs, so more"
programs will likely be up and running in the near future.
