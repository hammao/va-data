Dear Governor Kaine and Members of the Virginia General Assembly:
"On behalf of the Board of Education, I am pleased to transmit the 2009 Annual Report on the"
"Condition and Needs of Public Schools in Virginia, submitted pursuant to § 22.1-18 of the Code of Virginia."
"The report contains information on Virginia’s public schools, including an analysis of student"
academic performance and a report on the school divisions’ compliance with the requirements of
the Standards of Quality and the Standards of Accreditation.
The report contains compelling evidence that our schools and our students are achieving at higher
levels. The report also points to evidence that persistent challenges remain to be tackled. The
"progress shown by our public schools is the result of ongoing collaboration, dedication, workable"
"strategies, and wise use of resources, both human and financial. It is the result of the hard work of"
"students, teachers, administrators, support staff, parents, and supporters throughout the"
Commonwealth.
We see a challenging year ahead as we face the economic headwinds that have developed in recent
"months; however, the Board of Education remains focused on the fundamentals of improving"
"instruction for all students. Working together with the Governor, members of the General"
"Assembly, school and community leaders, parents, and private partners, we can improve public"
education for all of Virginia’s young people.
The Board of Education is grateful for the support the Governor and General Assembly continue to
"give to Virginia’s school improvement efforts. As we look to the future, the members of the Board"
of Education pledge to remain focused on providing the best educational opportunities and the
brightest future for the young people enrolled in Virginia’s public schools.
"Sincerely,"
"Mark E. Emblidge, Ph.D."
"President, Board of Education"
