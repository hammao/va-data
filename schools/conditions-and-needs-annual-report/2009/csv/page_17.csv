,technological changes and will have experienced a wider variety of learning styles than
,students in the past. This change in teaching/learning approaches has been underway for
,"some time, but it is accelerating and changing the character of the learning experience for"
,"students, and will continue to do so for classroom teachers, many of whom require training"
,in the appropriate and efficient use of the technology.
•,Safe and Healthy Environments for Students and Teachers:
,A high priority for the Board is dealing effectively with the realities of schooling for some
,"children who face difficult personal circumstances such as high poverty, high crime in their"
,"neighborhoods, high rates of unhealthy behaviors, poor nutrition, and other circumstances"
,that obstruct their learning at school. The Board of Education must help school divisions by
,"providing solid, workable guidelines and policies to assist those who are responsible for the"
,"health and safety of students and staff while they are at school, on school grounds, on their"
,"way to or from school, and involved in school-sponsored activities. The Virginia"
,Department of Education’s work to provide information and resources about H1N1 is a
,"good example. The Board must continue to stress the importance of successful,"
,communitywide partnerships in the development of procedures and policies that most
,"effectively support healthy, safe, orderly and disciplined school environments."
•,The Need to Assist Chronically Low-Performing Schools
,What to do about chronically low-performing schools is a central issue in the Board of
,Education’s school improvement efforts and accountability system. Its urgency is
,"underscored by the federal No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, which mandates an aggressive"
,system of corrective measures for schools receiving federal assistance that fail to meet
,progress goals.
•,"Preparation, Recruitment, and Retention of Educational Personnel"
,The current economic down-turn for the state and the localities will impact teacher
,"recruitment and retention. Due to budget limitations, many localities are proceeding with"
,"slimmed-down teacher recruitment and hiring. For some divisions, teacher and staff layoffs"
,"may be unavoidable. At least in part a result of economic hard times, hiring new teachers"
,will likely decrease because current classroom teachers will stay put by holding on to their
,jobs or by deferring retirement.
,"For the next several years, the reality for teacher supply and demand is two-fold: available"
,"teaching positions will become scarce except for some chronic shortage areas, and divisions"
,"will struggle to close looming budget gaps, making teacher and staff layoffs unavoidable for"
,some.
,"Digging deeper for the long term, additional, underlying demographics will impact teacher"
,recruitment and retention. Finding and retaining qualified teachers in chronic shortage areas
,"have been persistent problems for local divisions. Shortage areas include special education,"
,"mathematics, some foreign languages, and teachers of English as a Second Language. We"
,also see that the number of completers of Virginia’s teacher preparation programs is around
,"3,200 each year, far short of the 5,100 new and beginning teachers hired in 2008."
