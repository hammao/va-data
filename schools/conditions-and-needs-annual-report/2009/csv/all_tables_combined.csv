"The Honorable Timothy M. Kaine, Governor"
Members of the Virginia General Assembly
Commonwealth of Virginia
"Richmond, Virginia 23219"
Dear Governor Kaine and Members of the Virginia General Assembly:
"On behalf of the Board of Education, I am pleased to transmit the 2009 Annual Report on the"
"Condition and Needs of Public Schools in Virginia, submitted pursuant to § 22.1-18 of the Code of Virginia."
"The report contains information on Virginia’s public schools, including an analysis of student"
academic performance and a report on the school divisions’ compliance with the requirements of
the Standards of Quality and the Standards of Accreditation.
The report contains compelling evidence that our schools and our students are achieving at higher
levels. The report also points to evidence that persistent challenges remain to be tackled. The
"progress shown by our public schools is the result of ongoing collaboration, dedication, workable"
"strategies, and wise use of resources, both human and financial. It is the result of the hard work of"
"students, teachers, administrators, support staff, parents, and supporters throughout the"
Commonwealth.
We see a challenging year ahead as we face the economic headwinds that have developed in recent
"months; however, the Board of Education remains focused on the fundamentals of improving"
"instruction for all students. Working together with the Governor, members of the General"
"Assembly, school and community leaders, parents, and private partners, we can improve public"
education for all of Virginia’s young people.
The Board of Education is grateful for the support the Governor and General Assembly continue to
"give to Virginia’s school improvement efforts. As we look to the future, the members of the Board"
of Education pledge to remain focused on providing the best educational opportunities and the
brightest future for the young people enrolled in Virginia’s public schools.
"Sincerely,"
"Mark E. Emblidge, Ph.D."
"President, Board of Education"

following:,following:
•,Ninety-eight percent of Virginia’s public schools are fully accredited and meeting state
,"standards for achievement in English, mathematics, history and science based on 2008-2009"
,assessment results. This is the highest percentage of schools reaching full accreditation since
,the Commonwealth began accrediting schools based on student achievement ten years ago.
•,Virginia fourth-grade and eighth-grade students outperformed their peers nationwide and in
,the South in mathematics on the 2009 National Assessment of Educational Progress
,(NAEP). Students in only five states performed at what the National Center for Education
,"Statistics (NCES) considers a statistically higher level on the grade-4 test, and students in"
,only eight states achieved at a higher level on the eighth-grade assessment.
•,NAEP results for 2009 also show that African-American fourth graders in only two states—
,Massachusetts and Texas—achieved statistically higher average scores than those in Virginia.
,"No other states were statistically higher than Virginia in grade 8. In Virginia, the percentage"
,of African-American students in grade 4 meeting or exceeding the NAEP standard is
,significantly larger today than in 2000.
•,Virginia’s statewide assessment results also show that Virginia’s African-American and
,Hispanic students continue to narrow achievement gaps with white students in reading and
,mathematics.
•,Virginia ranks third in the nation in the percentage of high school seniors earning a grade of
,three or better on Advanced Placement (AP) exams. Students who earn scores of three or
,above are generally considered to be qualified to receive college credit and/or placement into
,"advanced courses. Among all states, Virginia is tied (with Florida) at third place in the"
,number of International Baccalaureate (IB) programs in local schools.

•,"Accurate graduation rates for the state, school divisions, and high schools were calculated for"
,the first time in 2008 using the longitudinal student-data system funded by the General
,Assembly. Eighty-two percent of the students in the class of 2008 graduated on time with a
,diploma.
•,"In 2009, Virginia high school students continued to fare better than their national"
,"counterparts on the ACT college admissions exam, and our graduates increased their"
,achievement in reading and mathematics on the SAT. African-American and Hispanic
,Virginia public school graduates again achieved at a higher level on all three SAT subsections
,than their counterparts nationwide.
•,"In 2008, 162 Virginia public schools earned the 2009 Governor’s Award for Educational"
,Excellence. The award is the highest honor under the Virginia Index of Performance (VIP)
,incentive program created by the Board of Education to encourage advanced learning and
,"achievement. Last year, 89 schools received the award."
•,The percentage of schools making AYP fell as federal benchmarks rose to 81 percent in
,"reading and 79 percent in mathematics. Nonetheless, the percentage of school divisions"
,making AYP increased by six points to 60 percent. Virginia and 71 percent of the public
,schools met or exceeded all No Child Left Behind (NCLB) objectives based on statewide
,"testing during the 2008-2009 school year as student achievement increased in reading,"
,mathematics and other subjects.
•,Industry certifications earned through CTE programs have nearly doubled since 2007.
,"During 2008-2009, 40 percent of CTE completers graduated with an Advanced Studies"
,Diploma.
•,"Education Week, a prominent education journal, ranks Virginia as a national leader in online"
,learning and the use of technology to expand opportunities for students.
•,The 2009 graduation rate is one point higher than the four-year rate of 82.2 percent for the
,class of 2008.

,Page 7
•,Addressing student needs in light of a persistent poverty rate that exists for children and
,"their families, which makes these children more likely to be sick as toddlers, unprepared for"
,"kindergarten, fall behind in grade school or drop out of high school, and are less likely to be"
,economically successful as adults.
•,Providing programs that address the increase in immigrant students—a large proportion of
,whom are also poor—who are more likely than others to drop out or leave school without
,the skills needed in a global marketplace.
•,"Eliminating gaps in graduation rates and student achievement, although improving, persist"
,among Virginia’s African-American and Hispanic students and their white and Asian
,counterparts.
•,Seeking new and efficient ways to use technology to reduce the testing burden on teachers
,"and students, but to do so in a way that will not reduce accountability standards and that can"
,be accomplished with available funding.
•,Dealing effectively with the realities of schooling for some children who face difficult
,"personal circumstances such as high poverty, high crime in their neighborhoods, high rates"
,"of unhealthy behaviors, poor nutrition, and other circumstances that obstruct their learning"
,at school.
•,Continuing the aggressive interventions by the Virginia Department of Education to assist
,divisions previously identified as low-performing.
•,Finding new and effective ways to help colleges and universities and school divisions in the
,"preparation, recruitment, and retention of teachers and other educational personnel."
•,Making a concerted effort to develop and promote policies to help divisions recruit and
,maintain minority teachers and educational personnel.
•,Maintaining emphasis on quality programs for at-risk four-year-olds across the state in an era
,of reduced resources.
•,"Finding and promoting new and effective ways to involve parents in their child’s education,"
,a critical need that must be addressed if Virginia is to promote safe and healthy school
,"environments, and eliminate achievement gaps."
•,"Helping teachers and administrators at all levels to gather, analyze, and use data to"
,continuously improve teaching and learning—the data analysis work that can lead their
,schools to understand what needs to change to get better results. A further challenge is to
,create new resources for professional development that put usable information into the
,hands of those directly responsible for students’ learning.

Virginia is Third in the Nation on Advanced Placement (AP) Results
Advanced Placement (AP) Test Results:
Virginia’s Ranking Among Selected States
2009
Virginia ranks third in the nation in the percentage of high school seniors earning a grade of three or
"better on AP exams. In 2008, the number of Virginia public school students who took at least one"
AP test increased by 8.8 percent. Students who earn scores of 3 or above are generally considered
to be qualified to receive college credit and/or placement into advanced courses.
Virginia Ranks Third in International Baccalaureate (IB) Programs
Virginia is among the states that continue to expand student access and participation in the
"International Baccalaureate (IB) program. IB encompasses a comprehensive, two-year curriculum,"
"along with community service and an independent project. To earn an IB diploma, students must"
"successfully pass examinations in literature, a foreign language, social studies, mathematics,"
"experimental sciences, and the arts. They also must write a 4,000-word essay, complete a theory"
"course that hones critical thinking skills, and perform community service. The exams are graded by"
teachers across the globe and compared against the results of thousands of students in 131
countries.
"According to a 2009 report from the Southern Region Education Board (SREB), IB programs are"
"blooming across the U.S. California leads all states with 68 programs, followed by Florida with 49,"
"and then New York and Virginia, which each have 35. In 2008, 1,278 Virginia high school seniors"
"received an IB diploma. This compares to 1,080 in 2007. In addition to the high school diploma"
"programs, the International Baccalaureate organization offers middle year and primary programs,"
"which are growing at a rate faster than the high diploma program. In fact, the primary program is"
"the fastest-growing program within the IB offerings. According to the IB organization, 5 Virginia"
public schools now offer the primary program and 32 schools offer the middle year program. A
"number of additional schools are now developing IB middle level and primary programs, so more"
programs will likely be up and running in the near future.

Students Outperform Peers on College Entrance Examination Results
ACT: Virginia high school students continued to fare better than their national counterparts on the
ACT college admissions exam. Seventy-four percent of Virginia's students met college-readiness
"English benchmarks compared with 67 percent nationally. For mathematics, 49 percent of Virginia"
"students met the mark, while 42 percent of students across the country did. For reading, Virginia"
"students were at 59 percent compared to the national number of 53 percent. In science, Virginia had"
33 percent reach the benchmark compared with 28 percent nationally.
SAT: Virginia public school graduates increased their achievement in reading and mathematics on
the SAT in 2009 and outperformed their peers nationwide on all three subsections of the college-
admissions test. African-American and Hispanic Virginia public school graduates again achieved at
a higher level on all three SAT subsections than their counterparts nationwide.
Number of High-Performing Schools Increases Significantly

Students Again Meet or Exceed Federal Benchmarks
Percentage of Virginia’s Schools Meeting Federal
Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) Benchmarks
2007 through 2009
The percentage of schools making AYP fell as federal benchmarks rose to 81 percent in reading and
"79 percent in mathematics. Nonetheless, the percentage of school divisions making AYP increased"
by six points to 60 percent. Virginia and 71 percent of the Commonwealth’s public schools met or
exceeded all No Child Left Behind (NCLB) objectives based on statewide testing during the 2008-
"2009 school year as student achievement increased in reading, mathematics and other subjects. It"
was the second consecutive year and the fourth time in the last five years that Virginia achieved what
"the federal law describes as “adequate yearly progress,” or AYP, toward 100-percent proficiency for"
"all students in reading and mathematics, the two subjects that are the primary focus of the federal"
law.
Student achievement — especially among minority students — increased overall and in critical areas
such as early reading and middle school mathematics. This continued progress (reflected also in the
NAEP results shown above) reflects improvements in teaching and learning in formerly low-
"performing schools and a data-driven, student-by-student approach to raising achievement."
On-Time Graduation Rate
Virginia is setting a national standard for accuracy in reporting graduation rates in a way that is easily
understood by the public. More than 83 percent of the students in the class of 2009 graduated on
time with a diploma. The 2009 “Virginia On-Time Graduation Rate” of 83.2 percent expresses the
percentage of students who were first-time ninth graders during the 2005-2006 school year and
earned a Board of Education-approved diploma within four years. The 2009 graduation rate is one
point higher than the four-year rate of 82.2 percent for the class of 2008.

following:,
•,Funding the Standards of Quality (SOQ)
,There can be no doubt that a challenging year is ahead as Virginia’s public schools face the
,"economic headwinds that have developed in recent months. In Virginia, Direct Aid to"
,localities for public education is the single largest General Fund expenditure. The current
,"fiscal climate at the state and federal levels challenges the stability of public education, social-"
,"services, and other supports for children and families. Resources are limited for students"
,"who require extra help, such as gifted students or students with disabilities who need special"
,attention. The challenge requires that all educators remain focused on the fundamentals of
,making sure every student under our charge is successful and that we remain committed to
,delivering results.

,"grade school or drop out of high school, and are less likely to be economically successful as"
,adults.
,"Since 2000, the poverty rate among Virginia’s school-age children has fallen, but not among"
,children in some areas of the state. Poverty distribution is uneven across the state – rural
,counties and central cities have the highest percent of students eligible for free and reduced
,lunch. Slightly more than one-third of public school children are eligible for free and
,"reduced-price lunch, up from less than 30 percent in 2000."
•,Changing Demographics
,"In 1998, Virginia’s public schools enrolled fewer than 27,000 Limited English Proficient"
,"(LEP) students. A decade later (2008) the number had risen to more than 87,000. This"
,"growth is expected to continue for the foreseeable future, placing a significant need for"
,resources for the public schools. Immigrant students—especially those that may also be
,poor—are more likely than others to drop out or leave school without the skills needed in a
,global marketplace.
•,Persistent Achievement Gaps
,This is one of the most pressing challenges that states across this nation face. Virginia is no
,exception. Gaps in graduation rates exist between Virginia’s African-American and Hispanic
,students and their white and Asian counterparts. This is equally true for students who are
,"economically disadvantaged. Although improving, gaps also persist on the statewide"
,assessments among Virginia’s African-American and Hispanic students and their white and
,Asian counterparts. Recent changes in federal education policy have put the spotlight on the
,"achievement gap issue, and schools are struggling to bring all students’ achievement up to"
,high levels.
,"The good news is Virginia is making progress. For example, Virginia boasts one of the"
,"nation's smallest achievement gaps between whites and Hispanics. Here, eighth-grade"
,Hispanic students had the highest NAEP writing scores for Hispanic students in any state.
,The persistent challenge is to accelerate this progress and raise the achievement of all
,students.
•,Availability and Use of Latest Technology
,"At the state level, Virginia is seeking new and efficient ways to use technology to reduce the"
,"testing burden on teachers and students, but to do so in a way that will not reduce"
,accountability standards. The infrastructure for such powerful tools is expensive to develop
,"and maintain. Moreover, technology and connectivity have made changes possible by"
,allowing access by essentially everyone to very large data sets or specialized information at
,any location and at any time. Students in the future will have grown up with these
,2009 Annual Report on Condition and Needs of Public Schools
,Page 16
,technological changes and will have experienced a wider variety of learning styles than
,students in the past. This change in teaching/learning approaches has been underway for
,"some time, but it is accelerating and changing the character of the learning experience for"
,"students, and will continue to do so for classroom teachers, many of whom require training"
,in the appropriate and efficient use of the technology.
•,Safe and Healthy Environments for Students and Teachers:
,A high priority for the Board is dealing effectively with the realities of schooling for some
,"children who face difficult personal circumstances such as high poverty, high crime in their"
,"neighborhoods, high rates of unhealthy behaviors, poor nutrition, and other circumstances"
,that obstruct their learning at school. The Board of Education must help school divisions by
,"providing solid, workable guidelines and policies to assist those who are responsible for the"
,"health and safety of students and staff while they are at school, on school grounds, on their"
,"way to or from school, and involved in school-sponsored activities. The Virginia"
,Department of Education’s work to provide information and resources about H1N1 is a
,"good example. The Board must continue to stress the importance of successful,"
,communitywide partnerships in the development of procedures and policies that most
,"effectively support healthy, safe, orderly and disciplined school environments."
•,The Need to Assist Chronically Low-Performing Schools
,What to do about chronically low-performing schools is a central issue in the Board of
,Education’s school improvement efforts and accountability system. Its urgency is
,"underscored by the federal No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, which mandates an aggressive"
,system of corrective measures for schools receiving federal assistance that fail to meet
,progress goals.
•,"Preparation, Recruitment, and Retention of Educational Personnel"
,The current economic down-turn for the state and the localities will impact teacher
,"recruitment and retention. Due to budget limitations, many localities are proceeding with"
,"slimmed-down teacher recruitment and hiring. For some divisions, teacher and staff layoffs"
,"may be unavoidable. At least in part a result of economic hard times, hiring new teachers"
,will likely decrease because current classroom teachers will stay put by holding on to their
,jobs or by deferring retirement.
,"For the next several years, the reality for teacher supply and demand is two-fold: available"
,"teaching positions will become scarce except for some chronic shortage areas, and divisions"
,"will struggle to close looming budget gaps, making teacher and staff layoffs unavoidable for"
,some.
,"Digging deeper for the long term, additional, underlying demographics will impact teacher"
,recruitment and retention. Finding and retaining qualified teachers in chronic shortage areas
,"have been persistent problems for local divisions. Shortage areas include special education,"
,"mathematics, some foreign languages, and teachers of English as a Second Language. We"
,also see that the number of completers of Virginia’s teacher preparation programs is around
,"3,200 each year, far short of the 5,100 new and beginning teachers hired in 2008."
,2009 Annual Report on Condition and Needs of Public Schools
,Page 17
,"Moreover, Virginia’s annual teacher turnover rate is slightly more than nine percent. For"
,"principals and assistant principals, the annual turnover rate is higher, at 10 percent."
,Approximately one-fifth of our teaching force and one-fourth of the principals and assistant
,principals are aged 55 or older—a significant number of teachers and principals now at or
,"nearing full retirement age. When considered as a whole, these demographics mean"
,"challenging times ahead, both short-term and long-term."
•,Recruiting Minority Teachers
,Boosting the diversity of Virginia's teaching staff is crucial at a time when educators are
,worrying about eliminating achievement gaps. The gap between the diversity of students in
,the schools and the ethnic characteristics of the teaching force poses a key question: will
,teachers reflect the tremendous diversity of the students they will serve? Not without a
,"concerted effort. In Virginia, 13 percent of teachers are African-American and 2 percent are"
,"Hispanic, compared with approximately 26 and 9 percent of students, respectively."
•,High-Quality Preschool Programs
,The number of school divisions participating in the Virginia Preschool Initiative has grown
,"from 75 in the 2001-2002 school year, to 114 in the 2008-2009 school year. Also, the"
,"number of children served has grown from 5,966 in 2001-2002 to 15,657 children in 2008-"
,"2009. Despite this growth, the number of at-risk four-year-olds in Virginia continues to be a"
,"concern. Without providing high quality preschool to all at-risk four-year-olds, many at-risk"
,five-year-old children will continue to enter kindergarten without adequate preparation to be
,fully ready to learn.
•,Promoting Parental and Family Involvement
,The family and the home are both critical education institutions where children begin
,"learning long before they start school, and where they spend much of their time after they"
,start school. It stands to reason that involving parents in their child’s education is conducive
,to learning. Such involvement is critical if we are to improve the educational achievement of
,"Virginia’s students, promote safe and healthy school environments, and eliminate"
,"achievement gaps. To do this, schools need to promote and enhance cooperative"
,partnerships in which families are allies in the efforts of teachers and schools.
•,Using Information and Research to Improve Student Learning
,The members of the Board of Education understand the need to take a leadership role to
,strengthen the bridge that connects research to the practice of teaching and learning. Dr.
,"Victoria Bernhardt, a nationally recognized authority in the use of research to improve"
,"student learning, asserts: “The more all staff are involved in collecting and analyzing data,"
,the more they will get involved in implementing the changes demanded by the results.” We
,agree. Finding ways to help teachers and administrators know how to properly interpret and
,use data will go a long way in ensuring that each child succeeds in the classroom.

"To help students who are struggling academically, programs such as the following are in place:"
"Virginia Preschool Initiative, the K-3 Class Size Reduction, the At-Risk Add-on, and the SOQ"
English as a Second Language programs. Additional programs include the Early Intervention
Reading Initiative; the Algebra Readiness Initiative; Project Graduation; Remedial Summer School;
"SOQ Prevention, Intervention, and Remediation; and the Regional Alternative Education Programs."
There is a wealth of data available to show the positive impact of each of these programs. Funds
made available through these programs are used for early identification and support of all students in
all content areas based on their poor performance on Standards of Learning assessments. Student
subgroups have shown improvement on all Standards of Learning tests since 2002-2003. Increases
"have been greatest for African-American students, economically disadvantaged students, English"
"language learners, and students with disabilities, thus helping to narrow the achievement gap."
Objective 6: The Board of Education will establish policies and standards that enhance the
"preparation, recruitment, and retention of educational personnel, including their"
"meaningful, ongoing professional development."
"Highly qualified teachers and educational personnel are essential. In 2008-2009, 98 percent of"
"teachers in core academic classes were considered highly qualified. However, these teachers are not"
"distributed evenly, as 3 percent of classes in high-poverty schools are taught by teachers who are not"
"highly qualified, compared to only 1 percent in low-poverty schools. This is an improvement from"
"2006-2007, when 5 percent of core academic classes in high-poverty schools were taught by teachers"
"who were not highly qualified, compared to 2 percent of core classes in low-poverty schools."
Another dimension of this challenge is the finding that our teacher work force as a whole does not
reflect the tremendous diversity of our student population in that 13 percent of Virginia’s teachers
"are African-American and 2 percent are Hispanic, compared with approximately 26 and 9 percent of"
"students, respectively."
"To address these and other issues related to teacher preparation, recruitment, and retention, the"
Board of Education tries to take full advantage of research-based information that improves our
"understanding of factors related to teacher preparation, recruiting, and retention, especially the role"
that the Board plays in system-wide policies promoting the teaching profession. It is felt that the
initiatives and programs briefly described below can help boost the ranks of minority teachers.
"These and other programs address the need to maintain competitive salaries and incentives, student-"
"teacher ratio, caring and supportive work environments and the overall value of the teaching"
profession.
Programs underway in the Department of Education include strategies that target diverse and
talented middle and high school students as potential teaching candidates. These initiatives also
stress the importance of providing support for teachers in the critical first years and offering
"ongoing professional development opportunities. Simply put, the strategies support the teaching"

divisions on their compliance with the provisions of §§ 22.1-253.13:1 through 22.1-253.13:8 of the
Code of Virginia (SOQ). The chairman of the school board and division superintendent certify the
level of compliance with the standards and the individual indicators within each standard to the
Department of Education via an electronic data collection system.
"It is important to note that where divisions indicate less than full compliance with the standards,"
corrective action plans for the noncompliance items are required. Of the divisions that were not in
"full compliance, all have filed a corrective action plan. The data are for the 2008-2009 school year"
"and for the SOQ that were in effect as of July 1, 2008."
Compliance with the Requirements of the
Standards of Accreditation
Ninety-eight percent of Virginia’s public schools are fully accredited and meeting state standards for
"achievement in English, mathematics, history and science based on 2008-2009 assessment results."
This is the highest percentage of schools reaching full accreditation since the Commonwealth began
accrediting schools based on student achievement ten years ago.
"Students in 98 percent, or 1,826, of Virginia’s 1,867 schools met or exceeded state objectives on"
Standards of Learning (SOL) tests and other statewide assessments in the four core academic areas
last year. Virginia’s public schools have accomplished what many ten years ago thought was
"impossible. With the sustained support of governors, legislators and policy-makers from both"
"parties, teachers and other educators have met the challenge of higher standards and students are"
achieving at significantly higher levels in nearly every school in the Commonwealth.
The percentage of middle schools achieving full accreditation increased again as the performance of
students on rigorous grade-level mathematics tests introduced four years ago continued to improve.
"Ninety-six percent, or 299, of Virginia’s 312 middle schools are now fully accredited compared with"
87 percent last year and 69 percent two years ago.
All but a handful of schools are now meeting or exceeding state standards even though the rigor of
the Commonwealth’s SOL accountability system has increased. The Board of Education will
maintain its focus on raising achievement in schools that have yet to earn and maintain full
accreditation.
"Appendix E shows the listing of divisions with all schools rated Fully Accredited, schools granted"
"Conditional Accreditation, schools rated Accredited with Warning, and schools rated Accreditation"
Denied.
The accreditation ratings are based on the achievement of students on SOL assessments and
"approved substitute tests in English, mathematics, history and science administered during the"
"summer and fall of 2008 and the spring of 2009, or on overall achievement during the three most"
recent academic years. The results of tests administered in each subject area are combined to
"produce overall school passing percentages in English, mathematics, history and science."

Closing Statement by the
Virginia Board of Education
The Board of Education’s priorities for action may be summed up as this: Our priorities are based
upon a sincere expectation that every child will learn academic content at a high and challenging
"level, that any traditional excuses for failure will be swept off the table, and that assessments will be"
used to guide the next lesson as well as evaluate the previous one.
"In uncovering key components of successfully run schools, research points to strong instructional"
"leadership, a clear focus on academics, regular measures of academic progress, high-quality teaching,"
and good community and parent relations. The Board’s priorities for action clearly address each of
these factors.
The world in which we live—and certainly the one in which our children will live and work in the
"future—is constantly changing, constantly shifting. New technologies, higher level skills, and new"
"ways of working emerge every day, and our schools must provide an education that promotes not"
just competence but excellence. Keeping our system of public schools on a steady course and
continuing to deliver solid results despite huge challenges call for a keen sense of what is required to
move from competence to excellence. It requires a steady focus on goals and on what needs to be
our highest priority.
"Education is the foundation for everything else we do, from economic development to health care."
"We are facing some difficult challenges today, but the key solution to these challenges remains the"
"same: Be measured by strong academic standards, reach strong standards, and exceed strong"
"standards. By doing so, young Virginians will surely lead the nation in educational progress. We are"
well on our way.

Reported by NCLB Subgroups
Assessment Results by Subgroup
The Virginia Assessment Program includes Standards of Learning (SOL) tests and other statewide
"assessments in English, history/social science, mathematics, and science. The tables below provide"
"information for the three most recent years on the achievement of students on these tests, including"
percentages of students who demonstrate proficiency and advanced proficiency. Annual
accountability ratings are based on achievement during the previous academic year or combined
achievement from the three most recent years. Only student subgroups represented are listed.
"Schools, school divisions, and states are rated according to the progress toward the goals of the No"
Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB). This federal law requires states to set annual benchmarks for
"achievement in reading and mathematics leading to 100 percent proficiency by 2014. Schools, school"
"divisions, and states that meet or exceed all annual benchmarks toward this goal are rated as having"
"made adequate yearly progress (AYP). Schools, school divisions, states must test at least 95 percent"
"of students overall, and 95 percent of students in each of the following subgroups: white, black,"
"Hispanic, students with disabilities, limited English proficient students, and students identified as"
disadvantaged. Annual accountability ratings are based on achievement during the previous
academic year or combined achievement from the three most recent years.

Appendix G:
2009 STANDARDS OF QUALITY
Board of Education Recommendations to the 2010 Session of
the Virginia General Assembly
Standards of Quality
Proposed Legislative Changes
§ 22.1-253.13:1. Standard 1. Instructional programs supporting the Standards of Learning and other
educational objectives.
A. The fundamental goal of the public schools of this Commonwealth must be to enable each student to
"develop the skills that are necessary for success in school, preparation for life, and reaching their full"
potential. The General Assembly and the Board of Education fund that the quality of education is dependent
"upon the provision of (i) the appropriate working environment, benefits, and salaries necessary to ensure the"
availability of high-quality instructional personnel; (ii) the appropriate learning environment designed to
promote student achievement; (iii) quality instruction that enables each student to become a productive and
educated citizen of Virginia and the United States of America; and (iv) the adequate commitment of other
"resources. In keeping with this goal, the General Assembly shall provide for the support of public education"
"as set forth in Article VIII, Section 1 of the Constitution of Virginia."
"B. The Board of Education shall establish educational objectives known as the Standards of Learning, which"
"shall form the core of Virginia's educational program, and other educational objectives, which together are"
designed to ensure the development of the skills that are necessary for success in school and for
"preparation for life in the years beyond. At a minimum, the Board shall establish Standards of Learning for"
"English, mathematics, science, and history and social science. The Standards of Learning shall not be"
construed to be regulations as defined in § 2.2-4001.
The Board shall seek to ensure that the Standards of Learning are consistent with a high-quality foundation
"educational program. The Standards of Learning shall include, but not be limited to, the basic skills of"
"communication (listening, speaking, reading, and writing); computation and critical reasoning including"
problem solving and decision making; proficiency in the use of computers and related technology; and the
skills to manage personal finances and to make sound financial decisions.
The English Standards of Learning for reading in kindergarten through grade three shall be based on
"components of effective reading instruction, to include, at a minimum, phonemic awareness, phonics,"
"fluency, vocabulary development, and text comprehension."
The Standards of Learning in all subject areas shall be subject to regular review and revision to maintain
rigor and to reflect a balance between content knowledge and the application of knowledge in preparation
"for eventual employment and lifelong learning. The Board of Education shall establish a regular schedule, in"
"a manner it deems appropriate, for the review, and revision as may be necessary, of the Standards of"
Learning in all subject areas. Such review of each subject area shall occur at least once every seven years.
Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the Board from conducting such review and revision on
a more frequent basis.
"To provide appropriate opportunity for input from the general public, teachers, and local school boards, the"
Board of Education shall conduct public hearings prior to establishing revised Standards of Learning. Thirty
"days prior to conducting such hearings, the Board shall give notice of the date, time, and place of the"
hearings to all local school boards and any other persons requesting to be notified of the hearings and
publish notice of its intention to revise the Standards of Learning in the Virginia Register of Regulations.
Interested parties shall be given reasonable opportunity to be heard and present information prior to final
adoption of any revisions of the Standards of Learning.
"In addition, the Department of Education shall make available and maintain a website, either separately or"
"through an existing website utilized by the Department of Education, enabling public elementary, middle,"
and high school educators to submit recommendations for improvements relating to the Standards of
"Learning, when under review by the Board according to its established schedule, and related assessments"
required by the Standards of Quality pursuant to this chapter. Such website shall facilitate the submission of
recommendations by educators.
2009 Annual Report on Condition and Needs of Public Schools
Page 54
School boards shall implement the Standards of Learning or objectives specifically designed for their school
divisions that are equivalent to or exceed the Board's requirements. Students shall be expected to achieve
the educational objectives established by the school division at appropriate age or grade levels. The
curriculum adopted by the local school division shall be aligned to the Standards of Learning.
The Board of Education shall include in the Standards of Learning for history and social science the study of
"contributions to society of diverse people. For the purposes of this subsection, ""diverse"" shall include"
"consideration of disability, ethnicity, race, and gender."
"With such funds as are made available for this purpose, the Board shall regularly review and revise the"
"competencies for career and technical education programs to require the full integration of English,"
"mathematics, science, and history and social science Standards of Learning. Career and technical"
"education programs shall be aligned with industry and professional standard certifications, where they exist."
C. Local school boards shall develop and implement a program of instruction for grades K through 12 that is
aligned to the Standards of Learning and meets or exceeds the requirements of the Board of Education. The
"program of instruction shall emphasize reading, writing, speaking, mathematical concepts and computations,"
"proficiency in the use of computers and related technology, and scientific concepts and processes; essential"
"skills and concepts of citizenship, including knowledge of Virginia history and world and United States"
"history, economics, government, foreign languages, international cultures, health and physical education,"
environmental issues and geography necessary for responsible participation in American society and in the
"international community; fine arts, which may include, but need not be limited to, music and art, and practical"
"arts; knowledge and skills needed to qualify for further education, gainful employment, or training in a career"
or technical field; and development of the ability to apply such skills and knowledge in preparation for
eventual employment and lifelong learning and to achieve economic self-sufficiency.
"Local school boards shall also develop and implement programs of prevention, intervention, or remediation"
"for students who are educationally at risk including, but not limited to, those who fail to achieve a passing"
score on any Standards of Learning assessment in grades three through eight or who fail an end-of-course
test required for the award of a verified unit of credit. Such programs shall include components that are
research-based.
"Any student who achieves a passing score on one or more, but not all, of the Standards of Learning"
assessments for the relevant grade level in grades three through eight may be required to attend a
remediation program.
Any student who fails to achieve a passing score on all of the Standards of Learning assessments for the
relevant grade level in grades three through eight or who fails an end-of-course test required for the award
of a verified unit of credit shall be required to attend a remediation program or to participate in another form
"of remediation. Division superintendents shall require such students to take special programs of prevention,"
"intervention, or remediation, which may include attendance in public summer school programs, in"
accordance with clause (ii) of subsection A of § 22.1-254 and § 22.1-254.01.
"Remediation programs shall include, when applicable, a procedure for early identification of students who"
are at risk of failing the Standards of Learning assessments in grades three through eight or who fail an end-
of-course test required for the award of a verified unit of credit. Such programs may also include summer
"school for all elementary and middle school grades and for all high school academic courses, as defined by"
"regulations promulgated by the Board of Education, or other forms of remediation. Summer school"
remediation programs or other forms of remediation shall be chosen by the division superintendent to be
appropriate to the academic needs of the student. Students who are required to attend such summer school
programs or to participate in another form of remediation shall not be charged tuition by the school division.
"The requirement for remediation may, however, be satisfied by the student's attendance in a program of"
"prevention, intervention or remediation that has been selected by his parent, in consultation with the division"
"superintendent or his designee, and is either (i) conducted by an accredited private school or (ii) a special"
program that has been determined to be comparable to the required public school remediation program by
the division superintendent. The costs of such private school remediation program or other special
remediation program shall be borne by the student's parent.
The Board of Education shall establish standards for full funding of summer remedial programs that shall
"include, but not be limited to, the minimum number of instructional hours or the equivalent thereof required"
for full funding and an assessment system designed to evaluate program effectiveness. Based on the
"number of students attending and the Commonwealth's share of the per pupil instructional costs, state funds"
shall be provided for the full cost of summer and other remediation programs as set forth in the appropriation
"act, provided such programs comply with such standards as shall be established by the Board, pursuant to §"
22.1-199.2.

who is enrolled in a preparation program for the General Education Development (GED) certificate or in an
adult basic education program to obtain the high school diploma.
The Board of Education may adopt special provisions related to the administration and use of any SOL test
or tests in a content area as applied to accreditation ratings for any period during which the SOL content or
"assessments in that area are being revised and phased in. Prior to statewide administration of such tests,"
the Board of Education shall provide notice to local school boards regarding such special provisions.
