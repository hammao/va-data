Closing Statement by the
Virginia Board of Education
The Board of Education’s priorities for action may be summed up as this: Our priorities are based
upon a sincere expectation that every child will learn academic content at a high and challenging
"level, that any traditional excuses for failure will be swept off the table, and that assessments will be"
used to guide the next lesson as well as evaluate the previous one.
"In uncovering key components of successfully run schools, research points to strong instructional"
"leadership, a clear focus on academics, regular measures of academic progress, high-quality teaching,"
and good community and parent relations. The Board’s priorities for action clearly address each of
these factors.
The world in which we live—and certainly the one in which our children will live and work in the
"future—is constantly changing, constantly shifting. New technologies, higher level skills, and new"
"ways of working emerge every day, and our schools must provide an education that promotes not"
just competence but excellence. Keeping our system of public schools on a steady course and
continuing to deliver solid results despite huge challenges call for a keen sense of what is required to
move from competence to excellence. It requires a steady focus on goals and on what needs to be
our highest priority.
"Education is the foundation for everything else we do, from economic development to health care."
"We are facing some difficult challenges today, but the key solution to these challenges remains the"
"same: Be measured by strong academic standards, reach strong standards, and exceed strong"
"standards. By doing so, young Virginians will surely lead the nation in educational progress. We are"
well on our way.
