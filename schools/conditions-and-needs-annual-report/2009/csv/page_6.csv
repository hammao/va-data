following:,following:
•,Ninety-eight percent of Virginia’s public schools are fully accredited and meeting state
,"standards for achievement in English, mathematics, history and science based on 2008-2009"
,assessment results. This is the highest percentage of schools reaching full accreditation since
,the Commonwealth began accrediting schools based on student achievement ten years ago.
•,Virginia fourth-grade and eighth-grade students outperformed their peers nationwide and in
,the South in mathematics on the 2009 National Assessment of Educational Progress
,(NAEP). Students in only five states performed at what the National Center for Education
,"Statistics (NCES) considers a statistically higher level on the grade-4 test, and students in"
,only eight states achieved at a higher level on the eighth-grade assessment.
•,NAEP results for 2009 also show that African-American fourth graders in only two states—
,Massachusetts and Texas—achieved statistically higher average scores than those in Virginia.
,"No other states were statistically higher than Virginia in grade 8. In Virginia, the percentage"
,of African-American students in grade 4 meeting or exceeding the NAEP standard is
,significantly larger today than in 2000.
•,Virginia’s statewide assessment results also show that Virginia’s African-American and
,Hispanic students continue to narrow achievement gaps with white students in reading and
,mathematics.
•,Virginia ranks third in the nation in the percentage of high school seniors earning a grade of
,three or better on Advanced Placement (AP) exams. Students who earn scores of three or
,above are generally considered to be qualified to receive college credit and/or placement into
,"advanced courses. Among all states, Virginia is tied (with Florida) at third place in the"
,number of International Baccalaureate (IB) programs in local schools.
