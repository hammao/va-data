"To help students who are struggling academically, programs such as the following are in place:"
"Virginia Preschool Initiative, the K-3 Class Size Reduction, the At-Risk Add-on, and the SOQ"
English as a Second Language programs. Additional programs include the Early Intervention
Reading Initiative; the Algebra Readiness Initiative; Project Graduation; Remedial Summer School;
"SOQ Prevention, Intervention, and Remediation; and the Regional Alternative Education Programs."
There is a wealth of data available to show the positive impact of each of these programs. Funds
made available through these programs are used for early identification and support of all students in
all content areas based on their poor performance on Standards of Learning assessments. Student
subgroups have shown improvement on all Standards of Learning tests since 2002-2003. Increases
"have been greatest for African-American students, economically disadvantaged students, English"
"language learners, and students with disabilities, thus helping to narrow the achievement gap."
Objective 6: The Board of Education will establish policies and standards that enhance the
"preparation, recruitment, and retention of educational personnel, including their"
"meaningful, ongoing professional development."
"Highly qualified teachers and educational personnel are essential. In 2008-2009, 98 percent of"
"teachers in core academic classes were considered highly qualified. However, these teachers are not"
"distributed evenly, as 3 percent of classes in high-poverty schools are taught by teachers who are not"
"highly qualified, compared to only 1 percent in low-poverty schools. This is an improvement from"
"2006-2007, when 5 percent of core academic classes in high-poverty schools were taught by teachers"
"who were not highly qualified, compared to 2 percent of core classes in low-poverty schools."
Another dimension of this challenge is the finding that our teacher work force as a whole does not
reflect the tremendous diversity of our student population in that 13 percent of Virginia’s teachers
"are African-American and 2 percent are Hispanic, compared with approximately 26 and 9 percent of"
"students, respectively."
"To address these and other issues related to teacher preparation, recruitment, and retention, the"
Board of Education tries to take full advantage of research-based information that improves our
"understanding of factors related to teacher preparation, recruiting, and retention, especially the role"
that the Board plays in system-wide policies promoting the teaching profession. It is felt that the
initiatives and programs briefly described below can help boost the ranks of minority teachers.
"These and other programs address the need to maintain competitive salaries and incentives, student-"
"teacher ratio, caring and supportive work environments and the overall value of the teaching"
profession.
Programs underway in the Department of Education include strategies that target diverse and
talented middle and high school students as potential teaching candidates. These initiatives also
stress the importance of providing support for teachers in the critical first years and offering
"ongoing professional development opportunities. Simply put, the strategies support the teaching"
