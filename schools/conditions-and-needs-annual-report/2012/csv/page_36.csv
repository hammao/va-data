The performance of Virginia students on the SAT — the dominant college admissions test in the
Commonwealth — in 2002 and 2003 provided additional evidence that the SOL program was
making an impact on achievement. Virginia high school seniors posted a five-point increase in
mathematics on the 2002 SAT and four-point improvement in reading the following year.
The 2003 SAT scores represented an 11-point improvement in mathematics since the beginning
"of SOL testing in 1998 and a seven-point improvement in reading. Nearly 8,400 more Virginia"
high school seniors took the SAT in 2003 compared with participation five years earlier.
"“By taking the SAT in ever-greater numbers, Virginia students are showing that they are"
"increasingly confident of their academic abilities,” said Thomas M. Jackson Jr., who succeeded"
Christie as state board president.
New diploma standards take effect
"In 2003, Warner launched Project Graduation to help struggling rising seniors pass the SOL tests"
"required to earn a standard or advanced diploma. At the same time, Warner said there would be"
no retreat from the new diploma requirements due to take effect in 2004.
"Project Graduation, which remains part of the SOL program’s statewide system of support,"
"included regional summer academies — where students received focused instruction in reading,"
"writing, and Algebra I — and opportunities to retake corresponding SOL tests."
Thanks to Project Graduation and similar local initiatives — and the efforts of Virginia teachers
in preparing students for the higher diploma standards — predictions that tens of thousands of
seniors would be denied diplomas in 2004 did not materialize.
"Statewide, 2004 graduates equaled 73.5 percent of ninth-grade enrollment four years earlier,"
compared with an average estimated four-year graduation rate over the previous five years of
74.7 percent.
"Warner had fulfilled his promise not to “blink” — as other states had — when new, more"
rigorous diploma standards were about to take effect.
A 10-year trend of higher achievement
"By 2005, 92 percent of Virginia schools had earned full accreditation as student achievement on"
"the SOLs increased. ""This year's accreditation ratings cap a long, bipartisan process in which we"
"stood firm in our efforts to raise standards and insist on accountability,"" Warner said."
"“The commitment of successive administrations, the General Assembly, and the Board of"
Education to the Standards of Learning has allowed Virginia to increase student achievement and
"provide students and schools with a foundation for even greater success,” DeMary said."
The performance of Virginia students on national reading and mathematics tests in 2005
continued what DeMary described as a 10-year trend of higher achievement in reading and
mathematics reflecting the improving quality of instruction in the Commonwealth’s public
schools. Virginia fourth- and eighth-grade students again performed at higher levels than their
national and regional counterparts.
