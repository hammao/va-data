"A. Each local school board shall award diplomas to all secondary school students, including students who transfer"

"pass the prescribed tests, and meet such other requirements as may be prescribed by the local school board and"

"In addition, each local school board may devise, vis-a-vis the award of diplomas to secondary school students, a"
mechanism for calculating class rankings that takes into consideration whether the student has taken a required class
more than one time and has had any prior earned grade for such required class expunged.
