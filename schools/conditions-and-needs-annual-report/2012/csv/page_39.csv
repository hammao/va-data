Standards of Learning – students who traditionally have lagged behind are now achieving at
"higher levels,"" Cannaday said."
Virginia was the only state to receive a perfect score for academic standards from the American
Federation of Teachers (AFT) in the union’s Sizing Up Standards 2008 report. The AFT
"evaluated Virginia’s SOLs and the academic standards of other states for clarity, specificity and"
content. The report by the nation’s second-largest teachers’ union cited Virginia as the only state
"in the nation to meet the AFTs’ criteria for strong standards in English, mathematics, science and"
history at all grade levels and in all subject areas.
College- and career-ready standards
As it prepared to carry out legislatively mandated reviews of the Standards of Learning in
"mathematics and English, the Board of Education directed VDOE to study factors contributing to"
"success in postsecondary education. As part of that effort, the department asked the College"
"Board, ACT and the bipartisan education reform organization Achieve to compare their"
respective standards for postsecondary readiness with the English and mathematics SOLs.
The board’s determination to increase the rigor of the SOL program — by shifting its focus from
grade-level competency to college and career readiness — was reinforced by the relatively flat
performance of Virginia students on the 2009 NAEP. “Our challenge is to build on the progress
Virginia students have already made under the Standards of Learning program — especially in
"middle school and among minority students,” then-Board President Eleanor B. Saslaw said."
The 2009 revision of Virginia’s mathematics standards and the 2010 revision of the English and
"science SOLs reflected the input of the College Board, ACT and Achieve, as well as"
recommendations from college faculty and the business community.
"“If Virginia’s students master the state standards, they will likely be well prepared for both"
"workplace and college success,” Achieve reported."
"After taking office in 2010, Governor Robert F. McDonnell signaled his support for increasing"
the rigor of the SOL program as Virginia came under pressure from the US Department of
Education to replace the SOLs with the newly developed Common Core State Standards.
"""We can't go back,” McDonnell told the Washington Post in May 2010. “We've been working on"
this for 15 years.”
"The following month, the Board of Education reaffirmed its commitment to the SOL program"
and opposition to adoption of the Common Core as a prerequisite for participation in federal
competitive grant programs.
“The Standards of Learning are clear and rigorous and have won the acceptance and trust of
"Virginia educators,” the board said in a unanimously approved resolution. “Whatever"
adjustments might be warranted to ensure alignment of the SOL with the Common Core State
Standards can be made within the process through which the Board of Education exercises its
constitutional authority to establish standards for the Commonwealth’s public schools.”
"In January 2011, Superintendent of Public Instruction Patricia I. Wright, who succeeded"
"Cannaday during the Kaine administration and was reappointed by McDonnell, warned state"
