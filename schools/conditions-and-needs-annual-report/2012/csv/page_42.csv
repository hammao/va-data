"the benchmark pass rates required for full accreditation have increased, and high schools must"
meet goals for improving graduation rates.”
“The focus of the SOL program has shifted to the ambitious but vital goal of college and career
"readiness for all students,” Foster added. “Temporary declines in SOL scores and accreditation"
"ratings are signs that the Commonwealth is expecting more, not that students are learning less.”"
The 2013-2014 school year opened on an encouraging note as results from both the ACT and
"SAT college-admissions tests showed across-board-gains for Virginia students, despite"
nationwide declines in student achievement on both assessments.
The percentage of Virginia public school students meeting ACT’s college-readiness benchmarks
"in English, reading, mathematics and science was 10 or more points higher than the percentages"
nationwide. Black students narrowed the achievement gap in all three SAT subject areas by
achieving larger gains than Virginia public school students overall.
Foster said the SAT and ACT results demonstrated that Virginia students were continuing to
make progress under the SOL program and the college- and career-ready expectations introduced
by the Board since 2009.
International Comparisons
"In October 2013, a long-awaited National Center for Education Statistics study connecting 2011"
NAEP mathematics and science scores of American students with results from the 2011 Trends
in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) ranked Virginia eighth graders above
international averages in both subjects.
The study ranked the mathematics achievement of Virginia eighth graders higher than that of
"peers in 39 countries and systems, including Finland. Finland’s public schools are frequently"
"held up as a model for states to emulate. Only students in South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan"
"(Chinese Taipei), Hong Kong, Japan, Russia and Quebec ranked higher. Mathematics"
achievement in one country — Israel — was found to be similar to achievement in Virginia.
The study found that Virginia eighth graders achieved at a statistically higher level in science
"than students in 37 countries and systems, including Hong Kong and Russia. Students in only"
"four countries — Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan — were ranked higher. The study"
rated the science achievement of students in six countries and systems — including Finland — as
equivalent to that of Virginia students.
2013 NAEP
The 2013 NAEP reading and mathematics tests showed that the reading skills of Virginia fourth-
grade students improved significantly between 2009 and 2013. Forty-three percent of the
"commonwealth’s grade-4 students met or exceeded the NAEP proficiency, compared with 38"
percent four years earlier.
"In mathematics, 47 percent of the state’s fourth graders achieved scores at or above the proficient"
"level, compared with 46 percent in 2011, 43 percent in 2009 and 42 percent in 2007. The"
improvement since 2007 was seen as statistically significant.
