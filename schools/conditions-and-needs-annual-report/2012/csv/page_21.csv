addressed are:,addressed are:
,"Persistent achievement gaps among groups of students - Family income, race, disabilities,"
,"language proficiency, and other demographic factors remain too strong an indicator of"
,"passing rates on tests, high school graduation rates, and other measures of academic"
,success.
,Chronically underperforming schools - A small but significant number of schools remain
,chronically low-performing by state and federal standards. Improving these schools and
,"better serving the children who attend them will require focus, perseverance, resources,"
,and teamwork.
,Professionalism of the teaching profession - Attracting the best and the brightest
,"individuals into the teaching profession, supporting their continued professional"
,"development, boosting morale, and retaining those who excel is of critical importance to"
,student achievement.

,"Over the last five years, the accreditation bar has been raised through the introduction of"
,more rigorous curriculum standards and challenging new assessments that test students’
,problem-solving and critical-thinking skills as well as their content knowledge. In
,"addition, the benchmark pass rates required for full accreditation have increased, and"
,high schools must meet goals for improving graduation rates. The focus of the SOL
,program has shifted to the ambitious but vital goal of college and career readiness for all
,students. Temporary declines in SOL scores and accreditation ratings are signs that the
,"Commonwealth is expecting more, not that students are learning less. The Board, school"
,"divisions, and schools need to remain focused on raising the rigor of Virginia’s"
,"academic standards to reflect college and career readiness, while educating the public"
,about the impact of such changes. An historical overview of the Standards of Learning
,program is included in Appendix A.
,"Continued investment of resources is integral to improving student performance,"
,especially given the high expectations reflected in increasingly rigorous SOL tests and
,efforts to close achievement gaps among demographic groups. Many local school
,systems face declining resources as a result of the recession and find it difficult to serve
,"high percentages of students who are from low-income backgrounds, or who have"
,"limited English proficiency. While resources are declining in many localities,"
,expectations continue to increase for all students.
,"The Board will monitor the implementation and effects of new policies, including growth"
,"indicators and the A-F school grading formula, to assure the policies are fair, transparent,"
,and accurate. Many Board members expressed concern that the necessary data was not
,available during the timeline provided by the General Assembly for the Board to fully
,"consider the impact of the A-F grading system, given the implementation of rigorous new"
,SOL mathematics tests in 2011-2012 and science and reading tests in 2012-2013. The
,Board will monitor and reevaluate the policies to consider unintended consequences and
,refine such policies as needed.
,"It remains important to set high academic expectations for students with disabilities, but"
