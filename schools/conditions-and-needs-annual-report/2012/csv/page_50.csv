"but not be limited to, the minimum number of instructional hours or the equivalent thereof required for full funding"
and an assessment system designed to evaluate program effectiveness. Based on the number of students attending
"and the Commonwealth's share of the per pupil instructional costs, state funds shall be provided for the full cost of"
"summer and other remediation programs as set forth in the appropriation act, provided such programs comply with"
"such standards as shall be established by the Board, pursuant to § 22.1-199.2."

"a. Knowledge of careers and all types of employment opportunities, including, but not limited to, apprenticeships,"
"entrepreneurship and small business ownership, the military, and the teaching profession, and emphasize the"
advantages of completing school with marketable skills;
b. Career exploration opportunities in the middle school grades; and
"c. Competency-based career and technical education programs that integrate academic outcomes, career guidance,"
and job-seeking skills for all secondary students. Programs shall be based upon labor market needs and student
interest. Career guidance shall include counseling about available employment opportunities and placement services
for students exiting school. Each school board shall develop and implement a plan to ensure compliance with the
provisions of this subdivision. Such plan shall be developed with the input of area business and industry
representatives and local community colleges and shall be submitted to the Superintendent of Public Instruction in
