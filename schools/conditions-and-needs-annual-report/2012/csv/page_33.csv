Historical Overview of the Standards of Learning Program
The Standards of Learning (SOL) have provided a foundation for increased student achievement
for nearly two decades. The standards are at the core of a statewide system of support and
accountability that has helped make Virginia’s public schools among the nation’s best.
Origins of reform
"While the term “Standards of Learning” dates to the early 1980s, what Virginians today regard as"
the SOL program began in the mid 1990s in the wake of several ineffective attempts at reform
and dramatic declines in the achievement of Virginia students on national assessments.
"In 1994, the reading scores of Virginia fourth graders on the National Assessment of Educational"
"Progress (NAEP) plummeted. This jolt, coupled with a decade of declining SAT scores, lead to a"
bipartisan consensus around the need for more rigorous academic and instructional standards in
the Commonwealth’s public schools.
The structure of the reform took shape through Governor George Allen’s Commission on
Champion Schools and the work of the Virginia Board of Education and then-Superintendent of
Public Instruction William C. Bosher Jr.
"In June 1995, the Board of Education revised the Standards of Learning in English, mathematics,"
history and science to increase specificity and content rigor. Bosher described the revised SOLs
"as “the most rigorous set of standards in math, science, English and social studies Virginia has"
ever known.”
"Seven months later, Allen’s commission made its recommendations on the creation of an"
accountability program based on the new standards. The recommendations included statewide
"testing in all four content areas, an achievement-based school accreditation system and the"
publication of annual school report cards.
"In September 1997, the Board of Education revised its Regulations Establishing Standards for"
Accrediting Public Schools in Virginia to carry out the Commission on Champion Schools’
recommendations and create what we now call the SOL program.
SOL testing begins
"SOL testing began in 1998 as students in grades 3, 5, 8 and in high school took assessments in"
"reading, writing, mathematics, history and science. Results from the 1998 tests were used to"
establish proficiency standards for students.
"The following year, schools were assigned accreditation ratings based on student achievement on"
"the SOL tests. In 1999, only 116, or 6.5 percent, of the Commonwealth’s 1,791 schools met the"
"accreditation standard, although achievement increased on all tests. Under the new accreditation"
"standards, all schools were expected to have pass rates of at least 70 percent in all four content"
areas by 2006-2007.
"Despite the initially low pass rates on the new state tests, results from the 1998 national reading"
tests provided an early indication that the SOL program was having a positive impact on student
