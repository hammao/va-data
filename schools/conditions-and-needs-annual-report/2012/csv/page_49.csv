"Local school boards shall also develop and implement programs of prevention, intervention, or remediation for"
"students who are educationally at risk including, but not limited to, those who fail to achieve a passing score on any"
Standards of Learning assessment in grades three through eight or who fail an end-of-course test required for the
award of a verified unit of credit. Such programs shall include components that are research-based.
"Any student who achieves a passing score on one or more, but not all, of the Standards of Learning assessments for"
the relevant grade level in grades three through eight may be required to attend a remediation program.
Any student who fails to achieve a passing score on all of the Standards of Learning assessments for the relevant
grade level in grades three through eight or who fails an end-of-course test required for the award of a verified unit
of credit shall be required to attend a remediation program or to participate in another form of remediation. Division
"superintendents shall require such students to take special programs of prevention, intervention, or remediation,"
"which may include attendance in public summer school programs, in accordance with clause (ii) of subsection A of"
§ 22.1-254 and § 22.1-254.01.
"Remediation programs shall include, when applicable, a procedure for early identification of students who are at risk"
of failing the Standards of Learning assessments in grades three through eight or who fail an end-of-course test
required for the award of a verified unit of credit. Such programs may also include summer school for all elementary
"and middle school grades and for all high school academic courses, as defined by regulations promulgated by the"
"Board of Education, or other forms of remediation. Summer school remediation programs or other forms of"
remediation shall be chosen by the division superintendent to be appropriate to the academic needs of the student.
Students who are required to attend such summer school programs or to participate in another form of remediation
shall not be charged tuition by the school division.
"The requirement for remediation may, however, be satisfied by the student's attendance in a program of prevention,"
"intervention or remediation that has been selected by his parent, in consultation with the division superintendent or"
"his designee, and is either (i) conducted by an accredited private school or (ii) a special program that has been"
determined to be comparable to the required public school remediation program by the division superintendent. The
costs of such private school remediation program or other special remediation program shall be borne by the
student's parent.
