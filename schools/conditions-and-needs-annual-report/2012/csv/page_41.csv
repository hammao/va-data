Wright said the gains on the national mathematics tests confirmed the improvements in teaching
"and learning that followed the introduction of grade-level SOL testing in 2006, and mirrored"
increases in achievement on the middle school mathematics and Algebra I SOL tests.
Beyond multiple choice
"Students began taking SOL tests based on the 2009 mathematics standards in 2011-2012, and"
"new tests in reading, writing and science were introduced in 2012-2013. The new online"
assessments included innovative technology-enhanced items that required students to apply their
content knowledge and employ problem-solving and critical-thinking skills. The items mirrored
students’ classroom experiences and were widely praised by mathematics teachers and division-
level instructional leaders.
"As predicted, the new SOLs produced lower pass rates. But during 2012-2013, the second year"
"for the new mathematics assessments, students made gains on every grade-level and end-of-"
course mathematics test.
"“As schools adapt to the new SOLs and as our talented, hardworking teachers continue to engage"
"students, I am confident that we will see improvement in English and science scores just as we"
"did in math scores,” Board of Education President David M. Foster said. “In turn, we will"
"improve the odds that our graduates are equipped to succeed in a competitive, fast-changing"
world. We owe it to our students and to ourselves to set high expectations — and then to do all
that we can to help each student meet those expectations.”
In response to concerns from school divisions about the amount of time it took some students to
"complete the new mathematics SOL tests, VDOE surveyed teachers and other educators from 16"
"relatively high-scoring divisions. High expectations for students, thorough knowledge of the"
"2009 Mathematics SOL Curriculum Framework, and an emphasis on multistep problem solving"
and vocabulary throughout the year were cited as contributing to the success of students who
completed the new tests in three or fewer hours.
An online survey conducted at the close of the 2011-2012 school year found overwhelming
support among teachers for increasing the flow of SOL-related information and resources from
"VDOE directly to classroom teachers. As a result, the department in January 2013 launched"
"TeacherDirect, a weekly e-mail bulletin informing teachers of the latest SOL resources and"
professional development opportunities. This marked a significant break from the long-standing
practice of channeling information through school division central offices.
"By the fall of 2013, the impact of the Commonwealth’s college- and career-ready standards and"
assessments was clear in the accreditation ratings by VDOE.
"Seventy-seven percent, or 1,413, of Virginia’s 1,828 public schools were rated as fully"
"accredited for 2013-2014, compared with 93 percent for 2012-2013. The number of schools"
"accredited with warning nearly quadrupled to 395, and six schools have been denied state"
accreditation because of chronically low achievement.
"“Over the last five years, the accreditation bar has been raised through the introduction of more"
rigorous curriculum standards and challenging new assessments that test students’ problem-
"solving and critical-thinking skills as well as their content knowledge,” Wright said. “In addition,"
