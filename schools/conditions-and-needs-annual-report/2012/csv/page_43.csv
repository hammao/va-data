The reading achievement of Virginia eighth graders on the 2013 NAEP was flat. Thirty-six
"percent achieved at or above the proficient level in reading, the same percentage as in 2011."
“The 2010 revisions to the English SOL place increased emphasis on strengthening adolescent
literacy and equipping students with the reading skills they will need during their first year of
"college or in the work force,” Superintendent of Public Instruction Wright said. “As schools"
"implement these more challenging standards and state tests, I expect to see an improvement in"
the performance of Virginia middle and high school students on national reading assessments.”
Thirty-eight percent of Virginia eighth graders achieved proficient or advanced mathematics
"scores on the 2013 NAEP, compared with 40 percent in 2011. The two-point decline was not"
"statistically noteworthy. Eighth graders in only five states — Massachusetts, New Hampshire,"
"New Jersey, Minnesota and Vermont — achieved higher average math scores. The National"
Center for Education Statistics described the increase in grade-8 mathematics achievement in
Virginia since 2005 — when 33 percent earned proficient or advanced scores — as significant.
In Conclusion
"As his term as president of the Board of Education neared its end, Foster reflected on how far"
Virginia’s public schools have come under the SOL program and on the challenges that remain:
"“In education as elsewhere, those who would make sound policy look at long-"
term trends and multiple measures. All of the trends and measures point in the
"same direction: SAT scores are up, ACT scores are up, NAEP scores are up,"
"Advanced Placement scores are up, graduation rates are up, and minority"
"achievement is up. Remarkably, Virginians are even competing favorably with"
Finland and three dozen other countries in math and science assessments.
"“None of this has been easy, of course, nor will pursuing the road ahead to"
universal proficiency and the elimination of achievement gaps be easy. We still
have a lot of hard work to do. But as President Kennedy famously said of the
"space race, ‘We do not do these things because they are easy; we do them"
"because they are hard.’ Those who value the future of our young people, our"
"Commonwealth, and our nation will not do the easy thing and abandon the SOL-"
based reforms that have taken us this far. They will stay the course until we have
accomplished even harder things.”
