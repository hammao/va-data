After reviewing data from these reports and conducting monitoring interviews with the
"providers, the Department of Education has identified three primary issues of concern: some"
"approved providers are offering courses that have not been approved, some school divisions are"
not providing information on their Web sites about the approved multidivision online provider
"courses, and discrepancies exist between data submitted by providers and data reported in the"
Student Records Collection (SRC). These issues are detailed in the report in Appendix F.
IX. Virtual Virginia Overview
"As a program of the Virginia Department of Education, Virtual Virginia offers online Advanced"
"Placement (AP®), world language, core academic, and elective courses to students across the"
"Commonwealth and nation. Virtual Virginia is committed to providing high-quality, rigorous"
course content with flexibility to meet the varied schedules of schools and students. The Virtual
Virginia program strives to provide instruction that meets the individual needs of students.
Virtual Virginia works with Virginia public schools to provide students access to courses that are
"unavailable to them due to low enrollments, scheduling conflicts, and the lack of highly qualified"
teachers. Virtual Virginia ensures the availability of high quality and rigorous Advanced
Placement and world language courses to underserved populations and provides equity of access
to educational options throughout Virginia.
"Courses are delivered via the Internet through a secure, Web-based environment; students may"
participate at school or at home. The courses promote a high level of interaction among students
"and teachers. The content is media-rich, interactive, and engaging and is designed to address"
"different learning styles. The courses contain readings, discussion forums, written assignments,"
"various forms of media, student presentations and projects, case studies, simulations, virtual lab"
"assignments, models, interactivities, and opportunities for collaboration."
Virtual Virginia courses meet and exceed Virginia’s Standards of Learning. All Advanced
Placement courses are audited and approved by the College Board as well as the National
Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). The course completion rate for 2012-13 was 93.6
percent.
Virtual Virginia teachers are highly qualified and hold Virginia licenses in their content area.
"Although teachers’ loads vary by course, the average student to full-time teacher ratio is 1:109."
Public school students enroll in Virtual Virginia courses via their local school counselors.
"Schools must provide an adult mentor, the required textbooks, and technology resources. The"
local schools award letter grades and graduation credit for the courses taken.
Advanced Placement courses are tuition free for students participating in the Early College
Scholars (ECS) program; non-ECS students pay a reduced tuition of $375 times the Local
Composite Index (LCI). Standard courses are tuition free for public school students. Tuition is
"charged for nonpublic and out-of-state students; in addition, a $75 drop fee is assessed if students"
withdraw after the 21 st day of class.
"Virtual Virginia has served over 28,000 students since its inception in 2002. Currently there are"
