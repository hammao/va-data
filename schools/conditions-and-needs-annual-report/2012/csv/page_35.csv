instruction. Warner subsequently endorsed the SOLs explicitly during remarks to the Board of
Education and the Virginia Association of School Superintendents.
"At Warner’s direction, an Office of School Improvement was created within VDOE to work"
closely with low-performing schools to implement best practices.
Warner built on the Board’s academic review process with his Partnership for Achieving
Successful Schools (PASS) initiative. PASS paired Title I schools that had become subject to
sanctions under the federal No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 with similar schools that were
meeting state and federal standards. The initiative also identified community and private sector
partners to provide resources and opportunities for students and teachers.
Continued improvement and innovation
Year-to-year increases in achievement on the SOL tests resulted in ever-higher percentages of
"schools earning full accreditation. By the fall of 2002, 64 percent of the Commonwealth’s"
schools had met or exceeded the standards.
“In schools where principals and teachers are implementing best practices and working
"collaboratively with the department’s academic review teams, instruction is improving and"
"student achievement is rising,” DeMary said."
Virginia’s online assessment system continued to grow as more high schools began
"administering SOL end-of-course tests online. During the spring 2003 test administration,"
"students in 94 school divisions took approximately 76,000 online assessments. Schools reported"
that students were comfortable with the online format and that the web-based tests allowed
initially unsuccessful students the benefit of speedier retakes.
Results from the 2002 national reading tests showed that the skills of Virginia students continued
to improve and that the Commonwealth’s students were among the nation’s strongest readers.
The percentage of Virginia fourth graders at or above grade level in reading rose seven points to
37 percent. An equal percentage of Virginia eighth graders met or exceeded the NAEP
"proficiency standard in reading, a four-point improvement from 1998."
"Mark C. Christie, who led the Board of Education during the final year of the Gilmore"
"administration and the first year of the Warner administration, responded to criticism that the"
gains on the state and national tests did not represent real increases in learning. Christie’s May
2004 article in Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service’s Virginia News Letter also compared
the SOL program with earlier attempts at reform.
"Critics claim that these dramatic gains merely reflect ""teaching to the test."" This"
cliché is the most intellectually shallow of all the arguments made against the
SOL program. The SOL tests measure student learning of the SOL academic
"content, and our academic content standards in English, math, science and"
history are among the best in the nation. The SOL reading tests measure a
"student's ability to read, the SOL writing tests measure the ability to write, the"
SOL math tests measure the student's ability to do math. Do we want teachers to
teach these skills? Of course we do.
