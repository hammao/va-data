D. The Board of Education may pursue all available civil remedies pursuant to § 22.1-19.1 or administrative action
pursuant to § 22.1-292.1 for breaches in test security and unauthorized alteration of test materials or test results.
"The Board may initiate or cause to be initiated a review or investigation of any alleged breach in security,"
"unauthorized alteration, or improper administration of tests, including the exclusion of students from testing who are"
"required to be assessed, by local school board employees responsible for the distribution or administration of the"
tests.
Records and other information furnished to or prepared by the Board during the conduct of a review or investigation
"may be withheld pursuant to subdivision 11 of § 2.2-3705.3. However, this section shall not prohibit the disclosure"
of records to (i) a local school board or division superintendent for the purpose of permitting such board or
"superintendent to consider or to take personnel action with regard to an employee or (ii) any requester, after the"
"conclusion of a review or investigation, in a form that (a) does not reveal the identity of any person making a"
complaint or supplying information to the Board on a confidential basis and (b) does not compromise the security of
any test mandated by the Board. Any local school board or division superintendent receiving such records or other
"information shall, upon taking personnel action against a relevant employee, place copies of such records or"
information relating to the specific employee in such person's personnel file.
"Notwithstanding any other provision of state law, no test or examination authorized by this section, including the"
"Standards of Learning assessments, shall be released or required to be released as minimum competency tests, if, in"

questions necessary to construct future secure tests.

"vendors having the technical capacity and expertise to provide computerized tests and assessments, and test"
"construction, analysis, and security, for (i) web-based computerized tests and assessments for the evaluation of"
student progress during and after remediation and (ii) the development of a remediation item bank directly related to
the Standards of Learning.
"F. To assess the educational progress of students as individuals and as groups, each local school board shall require"
"the use of Standards of Learning assessments and other relevant data, such as industry certification and state"
"licensure examinations, to evaluate student progress and to determine educational performance. Each local school"
shall require the administration of appropriate assessments to all students for grade levels and courses identified by
"the Board of Education, which may include criterion-referenced tests, teacher-made tests and alternative assessment"
instruments and shall include the Standards of Learning Assessments and the National Assessment of Educational
