The Algebra Readiness Diagnostic Test (ARDT) was developed by VDOE and Internet Testing Systems (ITS). This Web-based
application employs a computer adaptive testing engine to help determine student proficiency in mathematics. The assessment
was administered in Tier 1 and 2 schools in grades 5-9. Results from the diagnostic test were available immediately online and
provided information correlated to the Standards of Learning reporting categories. This information was beneficial in developing
and focusing an intervention program for those students who are most at risk.
Virginia developed an electronic query system (through Datacation by Casenex) to provide principals with data needed to
make data driven decisions at the school level. This system was based on the quarterly reporting system required of all
"schools in improvement during the 2010-2011 year. School and district teams used the quarterly report to make strategic,"
data-driven decisions in order to deploy needed interventions for students who are not meeting expected growth
measures and/or who are at risk of failure and dropping out of school.
Teacher Leader Training
"In an effort to ensure schools in school improvement receive the Training for Instructional Leaders from the CII, four"
sequential training sessions were scheduled for the 2010-2011 school year. This was a train-the-trainer model where the
participants returned to their respective schools and trained their colleagues. During the training sessions the
participants were taught research-based strategies proven effective in working with at-risk student populations and
schools that are struggling with reaching Annual Yearly Progress (AYP).
Evaluation
Participants in webinars provided immediate feedback during brief polling sessions at the end of each webinar.
Participant feedback was shared with webinar instructors as needed in order to make adjustments in future webinars.

"The response is limited to 8,000 characters.",
Virginia Migrant Education Program (MEP) staff members take several steps to check that child count data are entered
and updated accurately. Local migrant coordinators are required to monitor the student information entered into the
"Migrant Student Data Collection (MSDC) system to ensure accurate records at both state and local levels. In addition,"
coordinators may generate MSDC student enrollment reports throughout the year and have been trained on using the
"national Migrant Student Information Exchange (MSIX) system, and can conduct data checks using the MSIX log-in."
"Throughout the year, the local migrant recruiters submit updated COE to the migrant coordinators that reflect changes"
and/or revisions to student information within the COE. The state director also monitors and tracks the flow of data from
the local MEP to the MSDC system as needed through the monitoring of random COE reviews. The state director
communicates with the local migrant coordinators to discuss programmatic issues and the status of child counts.
"Virginia conducts Title I, Part C, Federal Program Monitoring for division and regional MEP on a five year cycle. As part of"
"the monitoring process, Virginia monitors the following six categories: 1) Identification and Recruitment; 2) State and"
Student Assessment; 3) Program Services and Provision of Services; 4) Parent and Community Involvement; 5) Fiduciary;
"and 6) Recordkeeping. For the purposes of verifying child count data, if the monitoring indicates that records are not being"
checked and cross-checked in the areas of Identification and Recruitment; Program Services and Provision of Services;
"and Recordkeeping, corrective actions are taken."
"In the space below, respond to the following question: What final steps are taken by State staff to verify the child counts"
produced by your student information system(s) are accurate counts of children in Category 1 and Category 2 prior to
their submission to ED?
"The response is limited to 8,000 characters."
"Throughout the year, state staff reviews reports to ensure accuracy of eligible students present during the current reporting"
period. The local migrant coordinators generate student enrollment reports that show participants in the regular and
summer/intersession terms when determining the Category 1 and Category 2 child count. The MEP coordinators review the
reports before data are entered into the Migrant Student Data Collection (MSDC) system and submitted to the state
"director. If discrepancies are found, the local migrant coordinators communicate with MEP staff to determine whether a"
"correction is necessary. If clarification is needed, the state migrant director works with the Office of Migrant Education to"
"determine eligibility. Prior to submission of Category 1 and Category 2 child counts, at the state level, migrant data from the"
MSDC system are cross-checked against internal state eligibility/funding reports. Verification and review of the following
data elements are completed to ensure accuracy: 1) birth date (removal of children from birth to age two; 2) qualifying
"arrival date; 3) enrollment date; and 4) the exclusion of children served under the Continuation of Services provision, to"
"include previously eligible secondary students. In addition, the same data elements are collected from the local migrant"
coordinators as the U.S. Department of Education collects from states in the annual Consolidated State Performance
Report to ensure consistency.
"In the space below, describe those corrective actions or improvements that will be made by the SEA to improve"
the accuracy of its MEP eligibility determinations in light of the prospective re-interviewing results.
"The response is limited to 8,000 characters."
"To improve eligibility determinations, the VDOE updated the Migrant Education Identification and Recruitment Manual in"
"January 2011. Key federal definitions such as temporary and continuation of services provision, the use of the Migrant"
"Student Data Collection (MSDC) and the Migrant Student Information Exchange were emphasized. In addition, the VDOE"
provided refresher training on eligibility requirements and MSDC system updates for local migrant coordinators on April
"13, 2011. All local migrant coordinators were in attendance. Technical assistance is provided by the VDOE as needed"
throughout the year.
"In the space below, discuss any concerns about the accuracy of the reported child counts or the underlying"
eligibility determinations on which the counts are based.
"The response is limited to 8,000 characters."
Virginia does not have any concerns regarding the accuracy of the child counts.
