The Algebra Readiness Diagnostic Test (ARDT) was developed by VDOE and Internet Testing Systems (ITS). This Web-based
application employs a computer adaptive testing engine to help determine student proficiency in mathematics. The assessment
was administered in Tier 1 and 2 schools in grades 5-9. Results from the diagnostic test were available immediately online and
provided information correlated to the Standards of Learning reporting categories. This information was beneficial in developing
and focusing an intervention program for those students who are most at risk.
Virginia developed an electronic query system (through Datacation by Casenex) to provide principals with data needed to
make data driven decisions at the school level. This system was based on the quarterly reporting system required of all
"schools in improvement during the 2010-2011 year. School and district teams used the quarterly report to make strategic,"
data-driven decisions in order to deploy needed interventions for students who are not meeting expected growth
measures and/or who are at risk of failure and dropping out of school.
Teacher Leader Training
"In an effort to ensure schools in school improvement receive the Training for Instructional Leaders from the CII, four"
sequential training sessions were scheduled for the 2010-2011 school year. This was a train-the-trainer model where the
participants returned to their respective schools and trained their colleagues. During the training sessions the
participants were taught research-based strategies proven effective in working with at-risk student populations and
schools that are struggling with reaching Annual Yearly Progress (AYP).
Evaluation
Participants in webinars provided immediate feedback during brief polling sessions at the end of each webinar.
Participant feedback was shared with webinar instructors as needed in order to make adjustments in future webinars.
