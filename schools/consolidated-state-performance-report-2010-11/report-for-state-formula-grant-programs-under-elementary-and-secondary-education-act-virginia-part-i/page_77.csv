coordinators who review for verification prior to being entered into the MSDC system. The Student Enrollment report may
be generated from the MSDC system when verifying the number of participants in the regular and summer/intersession
terms when determining the Category 1 and Category 2 child count. Once student enrollment numbers have been verified
"in the MSDC system, the local migrant coordinator selects the 'Submit to the DOE' button within the MSDC system, which"
close the data collection window for the reporting period.
"At the state level, the MSDC is reviewed based on peak enrollment patterns around the state, allowing local programs the"
time to input the majority of their students. A statewide student enrollment report is generated and cross checks are
compared against data entered in the MSDC as well as the Migrant Student Information Exchange database.
Discrepancies are addressed with the local migrant coordinators should inconsistencies exist.
"In the space below, describe how the child count data are inputted, updated, and then organized by the student"
information system for child count purposes at the State level.
"The response is limited to 8,000 characters."
The data are entered by the local migrant coordinators or designee for each local Migrant Education Program (MEP)
"around the state. The migrant coordinator is responsible for inputting and updating all data, to include the Certificate of"
Eligibility (COE) and Withdrawal Form.
The local migrant coordinators communicate with the MEP staff regarding COE information submitted to ensure accuracy
of new and existing student records. Student records are updated through withdrawal forms as well as changes to key
data fields within the child data of the COE. A separate withdrawal form is submitted upon a student's departure.
The local coordinators and recruiters evaluate the accuracy and efficiency of the forms used to collect the data.
"Throughout the year, each MEP coordinator trains program staff as needed. Reports from the local migrant coordinators"
"regarding identification certification, participation, and withdrawal are reviewed throughout the school year. The local"
migrant coordinators review program eligibility prior to entering student information into the MSDC. If the local migrant
"coordinator has concerns about eligibility, the state migrant director is consulted and a final review is conducted."
"If the data for the State's Category 2 count were collected and maintained differently from the Category 1 count, please"
describe each set of procedures.
"The response is limited to 8,000 characters."
