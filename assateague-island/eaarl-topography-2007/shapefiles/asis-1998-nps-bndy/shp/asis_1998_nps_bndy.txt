  Description:
    Abstract: This dataset is based off of the 1972 map boundary delineating the legal boundary of Assateague Island National Seashore (ASIS).This dataset originated from an ARC/INFO vector coverage.  It portrays updated shorelines as well as acreage, perimeter, area, and hectares of all parcels of land.
    Purpose: To identify the current boundaries of Assateague Island National Seashore due to westward island migration over a 26 year period.  This dataset is used for legal purposes even though the 1972 file is the boundary that Congress approved and recognizes.
    Supplemental_Information: This dataset is based off of the 1972 boundary file.  It was updated by taking precise measurements of the current (1998) shorelines and comparing them with the 1972 shorelines.  This procedure is explained in greater detail in the Process Steps.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: The mdbound ArcInfo coverage polygon vertices were moved using ArcView 3.0a to reflect the changes in the island coastline between 1972 and 1998.  This step involved measuring the distance between the 1972 coastline and the 1998 coastline every 500 meters  from the northern tip south to the route 611 bridge and averaging the changes within the two sections of greatest change on the north end.  The sisbnd72 ArcInfo coverage was then copied to a new coverage and the vertices moved westward either 1) the average change in the coastline measured of the west coast of ASIS, or 2) to the Federal Channel, whichever was closer.  A few vertices were added to the asisbnd98 coverage to ensure that the new boundary remained parallel to the coastline at the areas of extreme change.
