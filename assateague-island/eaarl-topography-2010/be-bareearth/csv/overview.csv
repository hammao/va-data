"Each pixel of the encoded GeoTIFF mosaic has an explicit elevation value associated with it. The GeoTIFF grid is encoded with the interpolated elevation value at a 2.5-meter resolution. The input parameters for the random consensus filter (RCF) were grid cell size (buffer) = 6 meters x 6 meters; vertical tolerance (vertical width) = 50 centimeters. The GeoTIFFs were created using Delauney triangulation, followed by linear interpolation based on routines used in the ITT VIS Interactive Data Language (IDL) code.","http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2009/1078/",0
