"The data were collected using a Pilatus PC-6 aircraft. The Experimental Advanced Airborne Research Lidar (EAARL) laser scanner collects the data using a green-wavelength (532-nanometer) raster scanning laser, while a digital camera acquires a visual record of the flight. The data are stored on hard drives and archived at the U.S. Geological Survey office in St. Petersburg, Florida. The navigational data are processed and then, along with the raw data, are downloaded into ALPS, or the Airborne Lidar Processing System (20100319 - 20110404). Data are converted from units of time to x,y,z points for elevation and formatted into .las and .xyz files. The derived surface data can then also be converted into raster data (GeoTIFFs). These GeoTIFFs are then mosaicked using ERDAS Imagine 9.3","20100319 through 20110404",0,0
