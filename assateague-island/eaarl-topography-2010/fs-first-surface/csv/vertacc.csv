"Typical vertical elevation accuracies for these data are consistent with the point elevation data, +/-15 centimeters. However, a ground-control survey is not conducted simultaneously with every lidar survey. Vertical accuracies may vary based on the type of terrain and the accuracy of the GPS and aircraft-attitude measurements.",0
