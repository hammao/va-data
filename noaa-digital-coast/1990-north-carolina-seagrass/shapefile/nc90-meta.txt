  Description:
    Abstract:
      A GIS data set of polygon data interpreted from aerial
      photography taken by NOAA/NOS Photogrammetry Branch
      depicting areas of Aquatic Beds of Rooted Vascular Plants
      in coastal north Carolina. Predominantly submersed rooted
      vasculars (SRV) but including some floating rooted
      vasculars (FRV). The nomenclature and definitions
      originally developed according to the Coastal Land Cover
      Classification System for the NOAA Coastal Change Analysis
      Project (C-CAP), Journal of Coastal Research 9(3):862-872
      have been crosswalked into the Florida System For
      Classification of Habitats in Estuarine and Marine
      Environments (SCHEME) to build consistency with
      similar NOAA developed benthic data sets.
    Purpose:
      To improve the understanding of coastal photic submersed
      lands and their linkages with wetlands and uplands, and
      with living marine organisms. To assist government agencies
      and others in making resource management decisions through
      the use of GIS.
    Supplemental_Information:
      Photointerpretation with a Wild AVIOPRET stereoscope.
      Photographs and data were compiled on a Bausch and Lomb
      stereo zoom transfer scope at a scale of 1:24,000 on USGS
      7.5' topographic maps or on NOAA shoreline topographic
      sheets scaled to 1:24,000 (original scale 1:20,000). Data
      is a merge of several coverages dependent on map base,
      photo mission, and photographic scale.

 DATA_QUALITY_INFORMATION:
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report:
      Attribute accuracy for habitat polygons has not been
      conducted. Field checks of all benthic signatures present
      in the photographs were conducted to resolve those benthic
      features that potentially could be confused with submersed
      rooted vegetation. The number and locations of site visits
      were based on judgement of the photointerpreter who led the
      field verification phase of the surface level sampling. In
      a second type of surface level work, a grid randomly placed
      on a nautical chart determined the nominal latitude and
      longitude of stations. These were sampled for species of
      submersed rooted vegetation and ancillary environmental
      information. The methodology was inappropriate for accuracy
      assessment of the remotely based haitat data for thre
      reasons. 1) Any plants within a quarter mile radius of the
      stations coordinates were sampled and indicated as positive
      in the field database. Rare ocurances of small clusters of
      plants would not be mapped from the photographs due to the
      minimum mapping unit. 2) Navigation to stations was
      accomplished with LORAN C which was spatially much less
      accurate than was expected with the photographic approach.
      Reference data must be a more reliable source than the data
      to be avaluated. 3) Some nominal station locations were
      unexpectedy deep or unsafe to approach or sample and were
      arbitrarily moved to an adjacent more appropriate location.
      This could have biased the spatial sampling.
  Logical_Consistency_Report:
    The classification scheme comprehensively includes all
    subtidal bottom classified for the presence or absence of
    submersed rooted vegetation. Void areas exceeding minimum
    mapping unit were mapped within vegetation polygons and are
    delineated and labeled. Overlay of the compiled and
    digitized polygons of vegetation included a few instances
    of overlap with dry land on the map base. This was
    particularly true for data compiled on 7.5' map bases due
    to the time differential between the photographic dates for
    the map bases (typically 1940s for shorelines and 1970's or
    1980's for cultural features) and the aquatic bed
    photography (1985 to 1990) The shoreline moved in some
    cases. Logical consistency in terms of topology for
    vegetaion polygons was confirmed in ARC/INFO and test plots
    of the digitized data at the compilation sclale (1:24,000)
    were compared for consistency and similarity of
    cartographic style with the source maps and were edited if necessary.
  Completeness_Report:
    The classification scheme includes one class at the Class
    level and one at the Subclass 1 level within the SCHEME
    system. All SRV within the study area were delineated,
    unless flagged in the data set, to a depth of approximately
    10 feet lower mean low water (LMLW), deeper than aquatic
    beds are known to grown in the study area. Limited parts of
    the study area were not successfully photographed and
    therfore data for those locations are omitted from the
    coverage. The photography provides a record of only a
    single time period so that ephemeral beds not present at
    the time of photography are omitted. This may be the case
    for some Zostera marina beds, for example, which can sprout
    from seed in the late spring and die due to heat stress and
    exposure in the summer. Zostera marina is a perennial grass
    which over winters as rhizomes within the substrate.
  Positional_Accuracy:
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:
        Horizontal positional accuracy has not been established  for the data set. National Map Accuracy standards (at a
        compilation scale of 1:24,000) are assumed as the
        theroetical optimal accuracy of this data. Accuracy is
        limited by the accuracy and temporal coincidence of base
        map and interpretation of the aquatic bed data from
        photographs. In the case of USGS 7.5' topographic maps, the cultural information is more contemporary (up to 10 or 15
        years out of date) than the geographic information (up to
        45 years out of date). NOAA shoreline and cultural data
        (based on 1988 and 1991 photography) are within six years
        of the aquatic bed photography. The dearth of cultural
        information throughout most of the study area resulted in a dependency on geographic features for local horizontal
        control of the phoographic data. The aquatic bed
        photographs were more consistent with contemprorary NOAA
        shoreline topographic map bases (from 1988 and 1991)
        photography and use of these map bases presumbably
        increased overall accuracy of the vegetation map. Aerial
        photography is registered by local horizontal control to
        base maps in a zoom transfer scope. Reference features are readily identifiable and can be accurately positioned on
        the photograph and on the base map. Cultural feature are
        preferred and geogpracphic features are used if necesssary. The base maps are USGS 7.5' topographic series or NOAA shoreline topographic sheets.
    Vertical_Positional_Accuracy:
      Vertical_Positional_Accuracy_Report:
        The SRV data carries no vertical attributes and no
        assessment or measure of vertical accuracy was conducted.

  Resource_Description:
    This data was generated by the NOAA Beaufort Lab as a pilot
    methods development project for the NOAA NMFS Coastal
    Change Analysis Program. The benthic component of the
    program is now managed and implemented by the NOAA NOS
    Coastal Services Center. Recoding of the original
    classification attributes into the SCHEME system has been
    conducted in order to bring consistency to benthic data
    generated by the program. The
    original data compiled in the North Carolina State Plane
    coordinate system, zone 3200 with a North American Datum of
    1983 has been reprojected into a Universal Transverse
    Mercator projection, zone 18 to allow other benthic data to
    be integrated on a regional basis.
  Distribution_Liability:
    Although every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy
    of information, errors, and conditions originating from
    physical methods used to develop the data may exist. Users
    must assume resposibility to determine the appropriate use
    of these data. The data are not recommended for use in
    legal determinations and are intended for regional change
    analysis only.
