<abstract>
A GIS data set of polygon data interpreted from aerial
photography taken by NOAA/NOS Photogrammetry Branch
depicting areas of Aquatic Beds of Rooted Vascular Plants
in coastal north Carolina. Predominantly submersed rooted
vasculars (SRV) but including some floating rooted
vasculars (FRV). The nomenclature and definitions
originally developed according to the Coastal Land Cover
Classification System for the NOAA Coastal Change Analysis
Project (C-CAP), Journal of Coastal Research 9(3):862-872
have been crosswalked into the Florida System For
Classification of Habitats in Estuarine and Marine
Environments (SCHEME) to build consistency with
similar NOAA developed benthic data sets.
</abstract>
<purpose>
To improve the understanding of coastal photic submersed
lands and their linkages with wetlands and uplands, and
with living marine organisms. To assist government agencies
and others in making resource management decisions through
the use of GIS.
</purpose>
<supplinf>
Photointerpretation with a Wild AVIOPRET stereoscope.
Photographs and data were compiled on a Bausch and Lomb
stereo zoom transfer scope at a scale of 1:24,000 on USGS
7.5' topographic maps or on NOAA shoreline topographic
sheets scaled to 1:24,000 (original scale 1:20,000). Data
is a merge of several coverages dependent on map base,
photo mission, and photographic scale.

Attribute accuracy for habitat polygons has not been
conducted. Field checks of all benthic signatures present
in the photographs were conducted to resolve those benthic
features that potentially could be confused with submersed
rooted vegetation. The number and locations of site visits
were based on judgement of the photointerpreter who led the
field verification phase of the surface level sampling. In
a second type of surface level work, a grid randomly placed
on a nautical chart determined the nominal latitude and
longitude of stations. These were sampled for species of
submersed rooted vegetation and ancillary environmental
information. The methodology was inappropriate for accuracy
assessment of the remotely based haitat data for thre
reasons. 1) Any plants within a quarter mile radius of the
stations coordinates were sampled and indicated as positive
in the field database. Rare ocurances of small clusters of
plants would not be mapped from the photographs due to the
minimum mapping unit. 2) Navigation to stations was
accomplished with LORAN C which was spatially much less
accurate than was expected with the photographic approach.
Reference data must be a more reliable source than the data
to be avaluated. 3) Some nominal station locations were
unexpectedy deep or unsafe to approach or sample and were
arbitrarily moved to an adjacent more appropriate location.
This could have biased the spatial sampling.
</attraccr>
</attracc>
<logic>
The classification scheme comprehensively includes all
subtidal bottom classified for the presence or absence of
submersed rooted vegetation. Void areas exceeding minimum
mapping unit were mapped within vegetation polygons and are
delineated and labeled. Overlay of the compiled and
digitized polygons of vegetation included a few instances
of overlap with dry land on the map base. This was
particularly true for data compiled on 7.5' map bases due
to the time differential between the photographic dates for
the map bases (typically 1940s for shorelines and 1970's or
1980's for cultural features) and the aquatic bed
photography (1985 to 1990) The shoreline moved in some
cases. Logical consistency in terms of topology for
vegetaion polygons was confirmed in ARC/INFO and test plots
of the digitized data at the compilation sclale (1:24,000)
were compared for consistency and similarity of
cartographic style with the source maps and were edited if necessary.
</logic>
<complete>
The classification scheme includes one class at the Class
level and one at the Subclass 1 level within the SCHEME
system. All SRV within the study area were delineated,
unless flagged in the data set, to a depth of approximately
10 feet lower mean low water (LMLW), deeper than aquatic
beds are known to grown in the study area. Limited parts of
the study area were not successfully photographed and
therfore data for those locations are omitted from the
coverage. The photography provides a record of only a
single time period so that ephemeral beds not present at
the time of photography are omitted. This may be the case
for some Zostera marina beds, for example, which can sprout
from seed in the late spring and die due to heat stress and
exposure in the summer. Zostera marina is a perennial grass
which over winters as rhizomes within the substrate.

Horizontal positional accuracy has not been established  for the data set. National Map Accuracy standards (at a
compilation scale of 1:24,000) are assumed as the
theroetical optimal accuracy of this data. Accuracy is
limited by the accuracy and temporal coincidence of base
map and interpretation of the aquatic bed data from
photographs. In the case of USGS 7.5' topographic maps, the cultural information is more contemporary (up to 10 or 15
years out of date) than the geographic information (up to
45 years out of date). NOAA shoreline and cultural data
(based on 1988 and 1991 photography) are within six years
of the aquatic bed photography. The dearth of cultural
information throughout most of the study area resulted in a dependency on geographic features for local horizontal
control of the phoographic data. The aquatic bed
photographs were more consistent with contemprorary NOAA
shoreline topographic map bases (from 1988 and 1991)
photography and use of these map bases presumbably
increased overall accuracy of the vegetation map. Aerial
photography is registered by local horizontal control to
base maps in a zoom transfer scope. Reference features are readily identifiable and can be accurately positioned on
the photograph and on the base map. Cultural feature are
preferred and geogpracphic features are used if necesssary. The base maps are USGS 7.5' topographic series or NOAA shoreline topographic sheets.

an areal extent expressed in hectare units. Each polygon is
also assigned a code value which corresponds to the SCHEME
Class or Subclass 1 designation. The

minimum detection unit of approximately 1 meter and a
minimum mapping unit of 0.03 hectares. Attribute data do
not include species or SRV or ambient salinity.

This data was generated by the NOAA Beaufort Lab as a pilot
methods development project for the NOAA NMFS Coastal
Change Analysis Program. The benthic component of the
program is now managed and implemented by the NOAA NOS
Coastal Services Center. Recoding of the original
classification attributes into the SCHEME system has been
conducted in order to bring consistency to benthic data
generated by the program. The
original data compiled in the North Carolina State Plane
coordinate system, zone 3200 with a North American Datum of
1983 has been reprojected into a Universal Transverse
Mercator projection, zone 18 to allow other benthic data to
be integrated on a regional basis.

Although every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy
of information, errors, and conditions originating from
physical methods used to develop the data may exist. Users
must assume resposibility to determine the appropriate use
of these data. The data are not recommended for use in
legal determinations and are intended for regional change
