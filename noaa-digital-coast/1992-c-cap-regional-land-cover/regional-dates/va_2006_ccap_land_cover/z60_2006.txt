    Attribute_Accuracy_Report:
      According to accuracy assessment performed by MDA Federal for U.S. East Coast, the overall accuracy for the zone 60 2001 classification is 71% and 67.3% Kappa. The 2006 update is based on updating the change areas between 2001 and 2006 imagery, and overlaying the results over 2001 land cover. Therefore the accuracy of the 2001 product is a sufficient indication of 2006 update accuracy as well within +/- 3.13% (the percent of area changed from 2001). The following per class accuracies are based on 2001 assessment.

      Each class accuracy is as follows: (Errors of Omission/Commission)
      0 Background (N/A)
      1 Unclassified (Cloud, Shadow, etc)(N/A)
      2 High Intensity Developed (59%/87%)
      3 Medium Intensity Developed (23%/39%)
      4 Low Intensity Developed (28%/74%)
      5 Open Spaces Developed (57%/67%)
      6 Cultivated Land (91%/88%)
      7 Pasture/Hay (87%/85%)
      8 Grassland (63%/80%)
      9 Deciduous Forest (84%/88)
      10 Evergreen Forest (88%/96%)
      11 Mixed Forest (43%/95%)
      12 Scrub/Shrub (75%/64%)
      13 Palustrine Forested Wetland (94%/84%)
      14 Palustrine Scrub/Shrub Wetland (81%/68%)
      15 Palustrine Emergent Wetland (77%/94%)
      16 Estuarine Forested Wetland (N/A)
      17 Estuarine Scrub/Shrub Wetland (N/A)
      18 Estuarine Emergent Wetland (93%/100%)
      19 Unconsolidated Shore (0%/NA)
      20 Bare Land (97%/88%)
      21 Water (100%/93%)
      22 Palustrine Aquatic Bed (N/A)
      23 Estuarine Aquatic Bed (N/A)

      The validation points were sampled from the field collected dataset of points BEFORE classification. These points were witheld from classification and not viewed or modified by staff involved in the classification process. The sampling procedure involved a spectral/clump-based spatial stratification. The 2006 leaf-off MRLC mosaic was clustered to 100 clusters and clumped. This layer was divided into alternating clumps. The even clumps were sent to potential validation, odd to training. The process was repeated such that 1/4 of the field points were earmarked as validation points. These points were then reviewed for accuracy and placement by independent QC staff. Points that were not correct or too close to feature boundaries were either deleted or moved to more feature-centric locations. No points were added or changed, only moved or deleted. Probably over half of the points were modified. NOAA CSC requires 6 out 9 (2/3) pixels in a 3x3 window of the land cover to correctly match the validation points. The land cover was processed to determine the 2/3 majority call for each pixel and then intersected with the validation points in an error matrix to derive the above numbers.

      Post-Processing Steps: None

      Known Problems: None

      Spatial Filters: None

  Logical_Consistency_Report: Tests for logical consistency indicate that all row and column positions in the selected latitude/longitude window contain data. Conversion and integration with vector files indicates that all positions are consistent with earth coordinates covering the same area. Attribute files are logically consistent.

  Completeness_Report: Data does not exist for all classes. There are no pixels representing class 16 (Estuarine Forested Wetland) and class 23 (Estuarine Aquatic Bed). Class 1 (Unclassified) is intentionally left blank. All pixels have been classified. The NOAA Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP): Guidance for Regional Implementation, NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service Report 123, discusses the interagency effort to develop the land cover classification scheme and defines all categories.

  Positional_Accuracy:
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report: Landsat scenes were geo-referenced by Eros Data Center. Spatial accuracy assessed by MDA Federal is found to be to within 2 pixels accuracy.
    Vertical_Positional_Accuracy:
      Vertical_Positional_Accuracy_Report: There was no terrain correction in the geo-referencing procedure.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        This dataset was created by MDA Federal. This classification is based on Landsat TM imagery from the MRLC 2006 database. The study area is zone 60, U.S. East Coast.

        Pre-processing steps:
        Each Landsat TM scene was geo-referenced by USGS (United States Geological Survey) EROS Data Center. Then MDA Federal staff verified the scenes for spatial accuracy to within 2 pixels. The data was geo-referenced to Albers Conical Equal Area, with a spheroid of GRS 1980, and Datum of WGS84. The data units is in meters. At-satellite reflectance was performed on each scene and the tasseled cap transformation applied. All of the image data used was Landsat TM 5 or 7. The mosaicked dataset was used for classification.

        Change Detection:
        The next step was to determine the areas of change between 2006 and 2001. The change detection algorithm used is the Cross Correlation Analysis process (CCA) developed at MDA Federal. This copyrighted procedure produced 2 Z-score files per scene of likelihood of change. These files were thresholded and mosaicked to create a binary change layer for that scene. In addition to the CCA process, a model was used to determine the differences between the 2006 and 2001 tasseled-cap layers.  This layer was used to check for change areas that were not completely extracted by the CCA process. All of the binary files were mosaicked to create a change layer for the entire study area. A focal majority was run on the change layer to fill in some clumps to make sure all of the change was accounted for. The change layer is a slight over-estimation of change to make sure to include as much change as detectable.

        Classification:
        The classification of the change areas was a mixture of automated and manual approaches. The change areas were removed from the 2001 classification. The areas with no change between 2006 and 2001 were used as training for a Classification and Regression tree (CART) analysis of the changed areas. Modelling and hand-editing were used to further refine the CART output and create a final classification. The classified change areas were overlaid on the 2001 C-CAP product to create a 2006 C-CAP classification. Attributes for this product are as follows:

        0 Background
        1 Unclassified (Cloud, Shadow, etc)
        2 High Intensity Developed
        3 Medium Intensity Developed
        4 Low Intensity Developed
        5 Open Space Developed
        6 Cultivated Land
        7 Pasture/Hay
        8 Grassland
        9 Deciduous Forest
        10 Evergreen Forest
        11 Mixed Forest
        12 Scrub/Shrub
        13 Palustrine Forested Wetland
        14 Palustrine Scrub/Shrub Wetland
        15 Palustrine Emergent Wetland
        16 Estuarine Forested Wetland
        17 Estuarine Scrub/Shrub Wetland
        18 Estuarine Emergent Wetland
        19 Unconsolidated Shore
        20 Bare Land
        21 Water
        22 Palustrine Aquatic Bed
        23 Estuarine Aquatic Bed
        24 Tundra
        25 Snow/Ice

        Post-processing steps:
        The QA process during the creation the 2010 land cover identified some errors in the previous dates of land cover that needed to be addressed to make a more accurate product.  Editing was performed on all dates of land cover to address site specific and region wide issues.  While the changes may not be large in area and/or be directly reflected in the accuracy assessment, we feel the products more accurately reflect the land cover for the time period.
