  Description:
    Abstract: This is a final classification. This data set is the 2010-era classification of U.S. Mid-Atlantic. This data set utilized 14 full or partial Landsat scenes which were analyzed according to the Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) protocol to determine land cover.

    Purpose: To improve the understanding of coastal uplands and wetlands, and their linkages with the distribution, abundance, and health of living marine resources.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        This dataset was created by MDA Information Systems, Inc. This classification is based on Landsat 5 TM imagery from the MRLC 2011 database. The study area is zone 60, and portions of zone 64 and zone 65 - U.S. Mid-Atlantic Region.

        Pre-processing steps:
        Each Landsat TM scene was geo-referenced by USGS (United States Geological Survey) EROS Data Center. Then MDA Information Systems, Inc staff verified the 2006/2010 scenes for spatial accuracy to within 2 pixels for a more accurate change detection process between the 2 eras. The data was projected to Albers Conical Equal Area, with a spheroid of GRS 1980, and Datum of WGS84. The data units is in meters. At-satellite reflectance was performed on each scene and the tasseled cap transformation applied. All of the image data used was Landsat 5 TM. The mosaicked dataset was used for classification.

        Change Detection:
        The next step was to determine the areas of change between 2006 and 2010. The change detection algorithm used is the Cross Correlation Analysis process (CCA) developed at MDA Information Systems, Inc. in conjunction with the USGS MIICA change pixels. The change layer is a slight over-estimation of change to make sure to include as much change as detectable.  Impervious change pixel areas were applied, but slightly altered by using the NOAA CSC model/threshold approach.

        Classification:
        The classification of the change areas was a mixture of automated and manual approaches. The change areas were removed from the 2006 classification. The areas with no change between 2010 and 2006 were used as training for a Classification and Regression tree (CART) analysis of the changed areas. Modelling and hand-editing were used to further refine the CART output and create a final classification. The classified change areas were overlaid on the 2006 C-CAP product to create a 2010 C-CAP classification. Attributes for this product are as follows:
