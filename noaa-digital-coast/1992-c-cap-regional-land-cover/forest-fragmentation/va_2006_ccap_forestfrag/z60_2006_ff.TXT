    Description:
      Abstract: The Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) produces a nationally standardized database of land cover and land change information for the coastal regions of the U.S. (http://www.csc.noaa.gov/landcover) C-CAP products provide inventories of coastal intertidal areas, wetlands, and adjacent uplands with the goal of monitoring these habitats by updating the land cover maps every five years. C-CAP data can be used as a base layer for many GIS applications, or as an input for tools that produced derived products such as impervious layers or land fragmentation layers.  Forest fragmentation, as defined by the Society of American Foresters, is the process of dividing large tracts of forest into smaller isolated tracts surrounded by human modified environments.  Increased fragmentation negatively impacts a forest ecosystem's ability to protect water flow and quality, provide healthy habitat, and can impact its value as a timber and recreational resource.  The forest fragmentation data is a value added, post-processed product that has been derived from NOAA Coastal Services Center C-CAP land cover products.
      Purpose: To develop an understanding of the effects that forest fragmentation has on coastal uplands and wetlands.

  Data_Quality_Information:
    Attribute_Accuracy:
      Attribute_Accuracy_Report: This data is based on the C-CAP data sets that the Land Fragmentation Tool was run on.  For more information about and access to the C-CAP data sets, please visit http://www.csc.noaa.gov/crs/lca.
    Logical_Consistency_Report: Tests for logical consistency indicate that all row and column positions in the selected latitude/longitude window contain data.  Conversion and integration with vector files indicates that all positions are consistent with earth coordinates covering the same area. Attribute files appear to be logically consistent.
    Completeness_Report: All pixels have been classified.
    Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
        Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report: Landsat scenes were georeferenced by Eros Data Center.  Spatial accuracy accessed by Earth Satellite Corporation is found to be to 1 pixel accuracy or less.
      Vertical_Positional_Accuracy:
        Vertical_Positional_Accuracy_Report: There was no terrain correction in the georeferencing procedure.

        Process_Description:
          CSC used the Landscape Fragmentation Tool (LFT) v. 2.0 from the University of Connecticut CLEAR website (clear.uconn.edu/tools/lft/lft2/index.htm).  Each date of the CCAP images for each coastal state were recoded from 25 classes to 3 classes.  The deciduous forest, mixed forest, evergreen forest, and palustrine forest classes were recoded to Forest (Class 2).  All of the remaining classes were recoded to Non-Forest (Class 1).  Class 0 is the background class.  The recoded 3 class images were input into the fragmentation tool.  An edge width of 30 meters was used in the fragmentation tool analysis.  The fragmentation tool outputs 6 classes, which include patch forest (Class 1), perforated forest (Class 2), edge forest (Class 3), and 3 classes of core forest (<250 acres, 250-500 acres, >500 acres).  The three core forest classes were recoded to a single core forest class (Class 4).

          Attributes for this product are as follows:
          0 Background
          1 Patch Forest
          2 Perforated Forest
          3 Edge Forest
          4 Core Forest
