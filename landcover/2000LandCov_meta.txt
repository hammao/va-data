      Title: RESAC Chesapeake Bay Watershed Land Cover - 2000 - Version 1.05
      Geospatial_Data_Presentation_Form: GIS coverage
      Online_Linkage: http://www.geog.umd.edu/resac/outgoing/
  Description:
    Abstract: A land cover map of the Chesapeake Bay Watershed plus the non-watershed components of counties that intersect the Watershed. The map has 17 cover classses modified from the Anderson Level II system. Landsat remotely sensed data and additional thematic data bases were used to create the map. A decision-tree classification was used, together with ad hoc algorithms to improve local accuracies. Landsat 7 ETM+ data were acquired for three seasons. The spatial accuracy is nominally 30m, but accuracy increases rapidly at larger minimum mapping units and, as a general rule, the map should not be used below 1ha (100m x 100m) resolution. The map extends beyond the watershed but has not been validated outside the watershed boundary and the intersecting counties.
    Purpose: To map land cover of the entire Chesapeake Bay Watershed consistently for large area ecosystem research, land management and land use planning.

      Process_Description: Landsat 7 ETM+ data acquired for 21 scenes for spring, summer and early winter. Data orthorectified, calibrated and converted to top of the atmosphere reflectance, cloud and cloud shadows removed, normalized to correct for topographic effects on incident solar radiation, and radiometrically normalized relative to overlapping data at scene edges. Corrected Landsat data plus selected digital data(e.g., elevation, road density) classified using multiple decision trees - a hierachical, monothetic, divisive statistical method. Final classes adjusted for user needs using postprocessing steps.
