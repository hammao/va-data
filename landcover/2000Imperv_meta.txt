      Title: RESAC 2000 CBW Impervious Surface Product - Version 1.3
      Geospatial_Data_Presentation_Form: data set
  Description:
    Abstract: Second installment (Version 1.3) of the Greater CBW Impervious Surface Product for the year 2000.  Values indicate the fractional amount of impervious material present in a single 30m x 30m pixel and range from 0-100%.
    Purpose: Aid in the development of impervious and land cover coefficients for watershed modeling efforts and useful for tracking the development occurring the the Greater Chesapeake Bay Watershed.

  Access_Constraints: Publically available data set made available by the Mid-Atlantic RESAC to the CBP. Data can be distributed for all in-house CBP operations of the HSPF modeling group and to the public under pre-determined conditions.
  Use_Constraints: None
Data_Quality_Information:
  Attribute_Accuracy: 
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report: Validation was performed using a mutually exclusive validation data set. The rms error for the impervious surface product version 1.3 is estimated to be 8-12%.
  Logical_Consistency_Report: N/A Raster Data
  Completeness_Report: Errors in value assignment for small and linear features are present due to the resolution limitations of the ETM+ sensor.  Other omissions and commission errors may exist based on the radiometric resolution of the ETM+ sensor and the cost-complexity pruning of the decision tree algorithm.
  Lineage:
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: The Mid-Atlantic RESAC acquired Landsat 7 ETM+ imagery (Level 0) for the entire Chesapeake Bay Watershed and the surrounding Counties.
      Process_Date: 20010124
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: The ETM+ imagery was then processed to Level 1, orthorectified (rms error < 0.5 pixel) and resampled to 30m
      Process_Date: 20010909
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: The orthorectified 30m product was processed to exoatmospheric reflectance values using published algorithms
      Process_Date: 20010909
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: Impervious surface training data was derived from GIS features in Montgomery County Maryland and the surrounding Mid-Atlantic region.  The data was split in to multiple sets of mutually exclusive calibration and validation data.
      Process_Date: 20010920
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: Variables were then derived from the orthorectified Landsat ETM+ imagery and used to developed a series of decision tree algorithms in the Splus software package.
      Process_Date: 20011021
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: The algorithms were then applied to the Landsat imagery and tested against validation data sets in an iterative process of algorithm development, testing and refinement.
      Process_Date: 20020224
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: A Bay-wide algorithm was then applied to the Landsat ETM+ imagery and quality assurance testing was performed.  Several problematic areas were identified and additional post processing steps were performed to produce the original version of the CBW product.
      Process_Date: 20010927
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: Additional edits were performed to reduce the effects of a cloud anomaly in the NW corner of p15-r33, to reduce visible scene boundaries through an image feathering technique and to mask additional agricultural/open soil errors.  These edits were evaluated using difference images at varying resolutions to reduce viewing scale related errors.

      Process_Description: Product delivery of the Chesapeake Bay-wide Impervious Surface Product version 1.3
      Process_Date: 20040319
Entity_and_Attribute_Information:
  Overview_Description: 
    Entity_and_Attribute_Overview: The value assigned to each 30m pixel is as units of percent impervious cover.
    Entity_and_Attribute_Detail_Citation: Impervious values range from 10 to 100% (10% being the lower limit of identifiable impervious features) and 0 being representative of non-impervious features.
